# IQueryable

- `IQueryable` is an interface that extends `IEnumerable` and is used for querying data from a data source.
- It allows for more complex queries and optimizations, especially when working with databases or other data sources that support query translation.
- Example of `IQueryable` usage:

```csharp
List<int> numbers = new List<int> { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };

IQueryable<int> queryableNumbers = numbers.AsQueryable().Where(n => n > 2);

foreach (var number in queryableNumbers)
{
    Console.WriteLine(number);
}
```

- Example of using `IQueryable` with a database context (Entity Framework):

```csharp
using (var context = new MyDbContext())
{
    IQueryable<Product> query = context.Products.Where(p => p.Price > 100);
    foreach (var product in query)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(product.Name);
    }
}
```

- Example of using `IQueryable` with LINQ:

```csharp
List<int> numbers = new List<int> { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };

IQueryable<int> queryableNumbers = numbers.AsQueryable().Where(n => n > 2);

foreach (var number in queryableNumbers)
{
    Console.WriteLine(number);
}
```

## Key Differences Between `IEnumerable` and `IQueryable`

- IEnumerable is a representation of a collection that can be enumerated, while `IQueryable` is a representation of a query that can be executed against a data source.
- **Execution**:
  - `IEnumerable` executes queries in memory, while `IQueryable` translates queries into a format suitable for the underlying data source (e.g., SQL for databases).
- **Performance**:
  - `IQueryable` can optimize queries by only retrieving the necessary data from the data source
  - `IEnumerable` retrieves all data into memory before filtering or processing.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Use `IEnumerable` for in-memory collections where you want to perform operations on the entire collection.
  - Use `IQueryable` for querying data from external sources like databases, where you want to leverage the data source's query capabilities and optimizations.
- **Deferred Execution**:
  - Both `IEnumerable` and `IQueryable` support deferred execution, meaning that the query is not executed until the results are actually needed.
- **Type Safety**:
  - Both interfaces are strongly typed, meaning that the compiler checks the types of the elements being queried at compile time.
- **Namespace**:

  - `IEnumerable` is defined in the `System.Collections` namespace, while `IQueryable` is defined in the `System.Linq` namespace.

- Example of using `IQueryable` versus `IEnumerable`:

```csharp
List<int> numbers = new List<int> { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };

// Using IQueryable there is deferred execution and query translation
IQueryable<int> queryableNumbers = numbers.AsQueryable().Where(n => n > 2);
// Using IEnumerable there is immediate execution and filtering in memory
IEnumerable<int> enumerableNumbers = numbers.Where(n => n > 2);


foreach (var number in queryableNumbers)
{
    Console.WriteLine(number);
}

foreach (var number in enumerableNumbers)
{
    Console.WriteLine(number);
}
```
