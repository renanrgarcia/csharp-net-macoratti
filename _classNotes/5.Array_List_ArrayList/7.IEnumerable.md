# IEnumerable

## List<T> vs IEnumerable<T>

- `IEnumerable<T>` describes a behavior of a collection that can be enumerated (iterated) over, while `List<T>` is a concrete implementation of a collection that can be enumerated.
- `IEnumerable<T>` is read-only, while `List<T>` allows for modification of the collection (adding, removing, etc.).
- `List<T>` has methods to manipulate the collection, while `IEnumerable<T>` only provides a way to iterate over the collection.
- `IEnumerable<T>` has a method to return the next element in the collection, so:
  - Does not need to have all elements in memory at once.
  - Does not know the size of the collection.
  - When iterating with `foreach`, it will not create a copy of the collection and return all elements of the collection.
- `List<T>` has all elements in memory at once, so:
  - It knows the size of the collection.
  - But it is more expensive to create a copy of the collection and return all elements of the collection.
- `IEnumerable<T>` provides defered execution, meaning that the actual execution of the code is delayed until the collection is enumerated.

- When to use `IEnumerable<T>`:
  - When you want to iterate over a collection without modifying it.
  - When you want to create a custom collection that can be enumerated.
  - When you want to provide a way to iterate over a collection without exposing the underlying implementation.
  - When you want to use the data only once and do not need to keep a copy of the collection in memory.
- When to use `List<T>`:
  - When you need to modify the collection (add, remove, etc.).
  - When you need to access elements by index.
  - When you need to know the size of the collection.
  - When you need to create a copy of the collection and return all elements of the collection.
  - When you need to use the collection multiple times and need to keep a copy of the collection in memory.
