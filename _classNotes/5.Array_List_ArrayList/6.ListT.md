# List<T>

- `List<T>` is a generic collection class in C# that provides a strongly typed list of objects that can be accessed by index. It is part of the System.Collections.Generic namespace and is implemented as a dynamic array, which means it can grow and shrink in size as needed.
- `List<T>` is type-safe, meaning that it can only store elements of the specified type `T`. This provides better performance and type safety compared to non-generic collections like `ArrayList`, which can store elements of any type.
- `List<T>` is more efficient than `ArrayList` because it does not require boxing and unboxing for value types, as it stores elements of the specified type directly.
  - `Boxing` is the process of converting a value type to a reference type, and `unboxing` is the reverse process. Boxing and unboxing can introduce performance overhead, especially when dealing with large collections of value types.
