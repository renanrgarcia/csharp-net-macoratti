# Relational Operators

- They are supported by integral types and floating-point types. They compare the values attributed to the variables and return a boolean value (true or false).

- `==` (Equal to): Checks if two values are equal.
- `!=` (Not equal to): Checks if two values are not equal.
- `>` (Greater than): Checks if the left value is greater than the right value.
- `<` (Less than): Checks if the left value is less than the right value.
- `>=` (Greater than or equal to): Checks if the left value is greater than or equal to the right value.
- `<=` (Less than or equal to): Checks if the left value is less than or equal to the right value.

## Using with strings

- `==` (Equal to): Checks if two strings are equal.
- `Equals`: Method to check if two strings are equal.
- The difference between `==` and `Equals` is that `==` checks for reference equality, while `Equals` checks for value equality.
