# Data Types

- **Reference types**: These types store a reference to the memory location where the data is stored.
  - Examples: `class`, `interface`, `delegate`, `object`, `dynamic`, `string`, `array`, `enum`.
  - They are stored in the `heap` memory. They can be added/removed in any order.
- **Value types**: These types store the actual data directly in the memory location.
  - Examples: `struct`, `enum`, `int`, `float`, `double`, `char`, `bool`, `decimal`.
  - They are stored in the `stack` memory. Here are `LIFO` (Last In First Out) data structures.

## Value Types

- Non-numeric types: `bool`, `char`, `Enum`, `DateTime`.
- Numeric types:
  - Signed integers: `int`, `long`, `short`, `sbyte`.
  - Unsigned integers: `uint`, `ulong`, `ushort`, `byte`.
  - Floating-point types: `float`, `double`, `decimal`.

## Reference Types

- `object`: The base type from which all other types derive. It can hold any data type, including value types and reference types.
- `string`: A sequence of characters used to represent text. Strings are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed after creation.
- `dynamic`: A type that bypasses compile-time type checking. It allows you to work with objects whose types are not known until runtime.
- `class`: A blueprint for creating objects. It can contain fields, properties, methods, and events. Classes are reference types.

## Variables and Constants

- **Variables**: Named storage locations in memory that can hold data. Variables can be changed during program execution.
- **Constants**: Named storage locations in memory that hold data that cannot be changed after initialization. Constants are defined using the `const` keyword.
