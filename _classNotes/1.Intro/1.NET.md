# .NET

- .NET is a software development framework created by Microsoft that provides a programming model, libraries, and runtime for building and running applications on Windows and other platforms.
- It supports multiple programming languages, including C#, F#, and VB.NET, and allows developers to create a wide range of applications, from web and desktop applications to cloud services and mobile apps.

## .NET Framework vs .NET Core vs .NET 5+

- .NET Framework: The original version of .NET, primarily for Windows applications. It is a mature platform with a large ecosystem but is limited to Windows.
- .NET Core: A cross-platform, open-source version of .NET that allows developers to build applications for Windows, macOS, and Linux. It is modular and lightweight, making it suitable for modern cloud-based applications.
- .NET 5+: The unification of .NET Framework and .NET Core into a single platform. It combines the best features of both and is the future of .NET development. Starting with .NET 5, Microsoft has been releasing new versions annually, with .NET 6 being a Long-Term Support (LTS) version.

## .NET Framework

- CLR (Common Language Runtime): The runtime environment that executes .NET applications. It provides services like memory management, garbage collection, and exception handling.
- BCL (Base Class Library): A set of classes and APIs that provide common functionality for .NET applications, such as file I/O, data access, and networking.

## .NET Core

- ASP.NET Core: A web framework for building modern web applications and APIs. It is cross-platform and designed for high performance and scalability.

## .NET Standard

- A specification that defines a set of APIs that all .NET implementations must support. It allows developers to create libraries that can be used across different .NET platforms (e.g., .NET Framework, .NET Core, Xamarin).

## Versions

- .NET 9: The latest version of .NET, released in November 2023. It includes new features and improvements for performance, security, and developer productivity. Support for .NET 9 will be available until November 2026.
- .NET 10: Expected to be released in November 2024, with a focus on further enhancements to performance, security, and developer experience. It will be a Long-Term Support (LTS) version, meaning it will receive updates and support for an extended period.

# C#

- C# (C Sharp): A modern, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft. It is the primary language used for .NET development and is known for its simplicity, readability, and strong type system.
- Program: A C# program is a collection of classes and methods that define the behavior of the application. The entry point of a C# program is the `Main` method, which is where execution begins.
- High Level Language: C# is a high-level language, meaning it abstracts away many low-level details of the hardware and operating system, allowing developers to focus on the logic of their applications rather than the underlying implementation.
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): C# is an object-oriented language, which means it uses objects to represent data and behavior. Key concepts of OOP include encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- Type safety: C# is a statically typed language, meaning that types are checked at compile time. This helps catch errors early in the development process and improves code reliability.
- Compilation: C# code is compiled into Intermediate Language (IL) code (like byte code on Java, for example), which is then executed by the Common Language Runtime (CLR). This allows for platform independence and optimizations at runtime.
  - CLR use JIT (Just-In-Time) compilation to convert IL code into native machine code at runtime, which improves performance.
