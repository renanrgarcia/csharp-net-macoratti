# IDEs

- An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development.
- Most used: Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, JetBrains Rider, MonoDevelop, and Xamarin Studio.

## .NET SDK

- The .NET SDK (Software Development Kit) is a set of tools and libraries that developers use to build, test, and deploy .NET applications. It includes the .NET runtime, compilers, and various command-line tools for managing projects and dependencies.
- `dotnet --version`: Displays the version of the .NET SDK installed on your system.
- .NET Runtime: The runtime environment that executes .NET applications. It provides services like memory management, garbage collection, and exception handling.
- `dotnet --list-sdks`: Lists all the installed .NET SDK versions on your system. This command is useful for checking which SDKs are available for use in your projects.
- `dotnet --list-runtimes`: Lists all the installed .NET runtimes on your system. This command is useful for checking which runtimes are available for running your applications.
- To change the default SDK version for a project, you can modify the `global.json` file in the project directory. This file specifies the SDK version to use when building and running the project.
- `dotnet new globaljson --sdk-version 6.0.8 --force`: Creates a new `global.json` file in the current directory with the specified SDK version. The `--force` option overwrites any existing `global.json` file.
- `global.json` file example:

```json
{
  "sdk": {
    "version": "6.0.8"
  }
}
```

## Template Projects

- Console Application: A simple command-line application that runs in a console window. It is suitable for small utilities and scripts.
- ASP.NET Core Web Application: A web application that uses the ASP.NET Core framework. It can be a web API, MVC application, or Razor Pages application.
- Class Library: A project that contains reusable code that can be shared across multiple applications. It compiles to a DLL (Dynamic Link Library) file.
- Unit Test Project: A project that contains unit tests for your code. It uses a testing framework like MSTest, NUnit, or xUnit to run tests and validate functionality.

## .NET CLI

- The .NET CLI (Command-Line Interface) is a cross-platform toolchain for developing, building, running, and publishing .NET applications. It provides commands for creating new projects, restoring dependencies, building applications, running tests, and publishing applications.
- `dotnet new`: Creates a new project or solution based on a specified template.
  - You can specify the template type using the `-t` or `--type` option, such as `console`, `web`, or `classlib`.
- `dotnet run`: Builds and runs the application in the current directory. It automatically restores dependencies and compiles the code before executing it.
- `dotnet build`: Compiles the application and its dependencies into a set of binaries. It generates an executable file for console applications or a DLL for class libraries.
- `dotnet restore`: Restores the dependencies and tools specified in the project file. It downloads the required packages from NuGet and prepares the project for building.
- `dotnet publish`: Prepares the application for deployment by compiling the code, restoring dependencies, and creating a self-contained package. It generates the necessary files to run the application on a target environment.
- `dotnet test`: Runs unit tests in the specified project or solution. It uses the testing framework specified in the project file to execute the tests and report results.
- `dotnet add/remove package`: Adds or removes NuGet packages to/from the project. It updates the project file and restores dependencies as needed.
- `dotnet sln`: Manages solution files. It allows you to add or remove projects from a solution, list projects in a solution, and create new solution files.

### Creating a New Console Project

- `dotnet new sln -o MySolution`: Creates a new solution file named `MySolution.sln` inside the `MySolution` directory. This solution file will be used to manage multiple projects within the solution.
- `cd MySolution`: Changes the current directory to `MySolution`, where the solution file is located.
- `dotnet new console -o MyConsoleApp -f net6.0`: Creates a new console application project named `MyConsoleApp` inside the `MySolution` directory. The `-f net6.0` option specifies the target framework for the project, which is .NET 6.0 in this case.
  - `--use-program-main`: This option specifies that the project shouldn't use the new C# 9.0 top-level statements feature, which allows you to write a simple `Main` method without explicitly defining it.
- `dotnet sln MySolution.sln add MyConsoleApp/MyConsoleApp.csproj`: Adds the `MyConsoleApp` project to the `MySolution.sln` solution file. This allows you to manage multiple projects within a single solution.
- `code .`: Opens the current directory in Visual Studio Code. This command is useful for quickly launching the IDE to edit your project files.

## Debug/Release Configurations

- `Build`: The process of compiling source code into executable code. In Visual Studio, you can choose between Debug and Release configurations for building your project.
- `Clean`: Removes all compiled files and intermediate files generated during the build process. This is useful for ensuring a clean build environment.
- `Rebuild`: Cleans and then builds the project again. It is useful when you want to ensure that all files are up to date and no stale files remain.
