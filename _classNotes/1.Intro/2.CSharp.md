# C#

- Characteristics:
  - Simple and powerful
  - Object-oriented
  - Strongly typed
  - Version Control
  - Legacy Code Support
  - Cross-platform
  - Managed Code: C# is a managed language, meaning that the runtime environment (CLR) manages memory allocation and deallocation, reducing the risk of memory leaks and other issues.
- Main project types:
  - Console Application: A simple command-line application that runs in a console window. It is often used for small utilities, scripts, or learning purposes.
  - Windows Forms Application
  - WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) Application
  - ASP.NET Core Web Application
  - Class Library: A project that contains reusable code that can be referenced by other projects. It is often used to create libraries of functions or components that can be shared across multiple applications.

## Reserve Keywords

- Keywords are reserved words in C# that have special meaning in the language. They cannot be used as identifiers (e.g., variable names, class names, etc.). Some common keywords include:
  - `class`: Defines a class.
  - `namespace`: Defines a namespace, which is a way to organize code into logical groups.
  - `using`: Imports namespaces or types into the current file, allowing you to use them without fully qualifying their names.
  - `static`: Indicates that a member belongs to the type itself rather than to an instance of the type.
  - `void`: Indicates that a method does not return a value.
  - `int`, `string`, `bool`, etc.: Define data types in C#.
  - `if`, `else`, `switch`: Control flow statements for conditional execution.
  - `for`, `while`, `foreach`: Looping constructs for iterating over collections or executing code repeatedly.
  - `try`, `catch`, `finally`: Exception handling constructs for managing errors and exceptions in code.
  - `public`, `private`, `protected`, `internal` : Access modifiers that control the visibility of class members.

## Indentifiers Rules

- Identifiers are names used to identify variables, classes, methods, and other elements in C#. They must follow certain rules:
  - Must start with a letter (A-Z or a-z) or an underscore (\_).
  - Can contain letters, digits (0-9), and underscores.
  - Cannot contain spaces.
  - Cannot be a reserved keyword.
  - Case-sensitive: `myVariable` and `MyVariable` are considered different identifiers.
  - Maximum length: Identifiers can be up to 512 characters long, but it's best to keep them concise and meaningful.
  - Use camelCase or PascalCase for naming conventions:
    - camelCase: `myVariableName` (used for local variables and method parameters)
    - PascalCase: `MyClassName` (used for class names and public members)

## Base syntax

- `//` Single-line comment
- `/* ... */` Multi-line comment
- `{}` Block of code
- `;` Statement terminator
- `:` Inheritance operator (used in class definitions to indicate base classes)
- `,` Separator (used in method parameters, variable declarations, etc.)
- `.` Member access operator (used to access members of a class or struct)
- `[]` Indexer operator (used to access elements in arrays or collections)
- `()` Parentheses (used for method calls, expressions, and grouping)
- `=>` Lambda expression operator (used to define anonymous functions or expressions)
- `=` Assignment operator (used to assign values to variables)
- `==` Equality operator (used to compare values for equality)

## Versions and changes

- C# 1.0: The first version of C#, released in 2000. It introduced the basic syntax and features of the language, including classes, methods, and properties.
- C# 2.0: Released in 2005, this version introduced generics, anonymous methods, and nullable types. Generics allow developers to create type-safe collections and methods that can work with any data type.
- C# 3.0: Released in 2007, this version introduced Language Integrated Query (LINQ), which allows developers to query collections using a SQL-like syntax. It also introduced lambda expressions and extension methods.
- C# 4.0: Released in 2010, this version introduced dynamic typing, named and optional parameters, and covariance and contravariance in generics. Dynamic typing allows developers to work with objects whose types are not known until runtime.
- C# 5.0: Released in 2012, this version introduced asynchronous programming with the `async` and `await` keywords, making it easier to write non-blocking code for I/O-bound operations.
- C# 6.0: Released in 2015, this version introduced several syntactic sugar features, such as interpolated strings, expression-bodied members, and null-conditional operators. These features improved code readability and conciseness.
- C# 7.0: Released in 2017, this version introduced tuples, pattern matching, local functions, and out variables. These features enhanced the language's expressiveness and made it easier to work with complex data structures.
- C# 8.0: Released in 2019, this version introduced nullable reference types, asynchronous streams, and default interface methods. Nullable reference types help developers avoid null reference exceptions by providing better compile-time checks.
- C# 9.0: Released in 2020, this version introduced records, init-only properties, and top-level statements. Records provide a concise way to define immutable data types, while init-only properties allow for more flexible object initialization.
- C# 10.0: Released in 2021, this version introduced global using directives, file-scoped namespaces, and interpolated string handlers. These features improved code organization and readability.
- C# 11.0: Released in 2022, this version introduced raw string literals, required members, and generic math. Raw string literals allow for easier multi-line string handling, while required members enforce initialization of certain properties in constructors.
- C# 12.0: Expected to be released in 2024, this version is expected to introduce new features and improvements, including enhancements to pattern matching, records, and performance optimizations. Specific details about the features are still being finalized.
- C# 13.0: Expected to be released in 2025, this version is anticipated to bring further enhancements to the language, focusing on developer productivity, performance, and modern programming paradigms. As with C# 12.0, specific features are yet to be confirmed.
