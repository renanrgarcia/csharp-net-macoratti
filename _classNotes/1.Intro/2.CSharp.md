# C#

- Characteristics:
  - Simple and powerful
  - Object-oriented
  - Strongly typed
  - Version Control
  - Legacy Code Support
  - Cross-platform
  - Managed Code: C# is a managed language, meaning that the runtime environment (CLR) manages memory allocation and deallocation, reducing the risk of memory leaks and other issues.
- Main project types:
  - Console Application: A simple command-line application that runs in a console window. It is often used for small utilities, scripts, or learning purposes.
  - Windows Forms Application
  - WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) Application
  - ASP.NET Core Web Application
  - Class Library: A project that contains reusable code that can be referenced by other projects. It is often used to create libraries of functions or components that can be shared across multiple applications.

## Reserve Keywords

- Keywords are reserved words in C# that have special meaning in the language. They cannot be used as identifiers (e.g., variable names, class names, etc.). Some common keywords include:
  - `class`: Defines a class.
  - `namespace`: Defines a namespace, which is a way to organize code into logical groups.
  - `using`: Imports namespaces or types into the current file, allowing you to use them without fully qualifying their names.
  - `static`: Indicates that a member belongs to the type itself rather than to an instance of the type.
  - `void`: Indicates that a method does not return a value.
  - `int`, `string`, `bool`, etc.: Define data types in C#.
  - `if`, `else`, `switch`: Control flow statements for conditional execution.
  - `for`, `while`, `foreach`: Looping constructs for iterating over collections or executing code repeatedly.
  - `try`, `catch`, `finally`: Exception handling constructs for managing errors and exceptions in code.
  - `public`, `private`, `protected`, `internal` : Access modifiers that control the visibility of class members.

## Indentifiers Rules

- Identifiers are names used to identify variables, classes, methods, and other elements in C#. They must follow certain rules:
  - Must start with a letter (A-Z or a-z) or an underscore (\_).
  - Can contain letters, digits (0-9), and underscores.
  - Cannot contain spaces.
  - Cannot be a reserved keyword.
  - Case-sensitive: `myVariable` and `MyVariable` are considered different identifiers.
  - Maximum length: Identifiers can be up to 512 characters long, but it's best to keep them concise and meaningful.
  - Use camelCase or PascalCase for naming conventions:
    - camelCase: `myVariableName` (used for local variables and method parameters)
    - PascalCase: `MyClassName` (used for class names and public members)

## Base syntax

- `//` Single-line comment
- `/* ... */` Multi-line comment
- `{}` Block of code
- `;` Statement terminator
- `:` Inheritance operator (used in class definitions to indicate base classes)
- `,` Separator (used in method parameters, variable declarations, etc.)
- `.` Member access operator (used to access members of a class or struct)
- `[]` Indexer operator (used to access elements in arrays or collections)
- `()` Parentheses (used for method calls, expressions, and grouping)
- `=>` Lambda expression operator (used to define anonymous functions or expressions)
- `=` Assignment operator (used to assign values to variables)
- `==` Equality operator (used to compare values for equality)
