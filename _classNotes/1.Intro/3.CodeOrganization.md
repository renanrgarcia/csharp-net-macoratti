# Code Organization

- **Assembly**: A compiled code library used by .NET applications. Assemblies are the building blocks of .NET applications and can be either executable files (EXE) or dynamic link libraries (DLL). They contain metadata, code, and resources required for the application to run.
  - `Executable (EXE)`: A file that can be run as a standalone application. It contains an entry point (usually the `Main` method) and can be executed directly by the operating system.
  - `Dynamic Link Library (DLL)`: A file that contains reusable code and resources that can be shared among multiple applications. DLLs do not have an entry point and cannot be executed directly. They are loaded by other applications at runtime.
- **Namespace**: A way to organize code into logical groups. Namespaces help avoid naming conflicts and make it easier to manage large codebases. They can contain classes, interfaces, enums, and other namespaces.
  - **Using Directive**: A statement that allows you to use types from a namespace without fully qualifying their names. For example, `using System;` allows you to use types from the `System` namespace without prefixing them with `System.`.
  - Ex: `using System.Collections.Generic;` allows you to use types from the `System.Collections.Generic` namespace, such as `List<T>` and `Dictionary<TKey, TValue>`, without fully qualifying their names.
- **Project**: A collection of related files and resources that are compiled into an assembly. A project can contain multiple source code files, configuration files, and other resources. In Visual Studio, projects are typically organized into solutions, which can contain multiple projects.
- **Solution**: A container for one or more projects. Solutions help organize related projects and manage dependencies between them. In Visual Studio, a solution is represented by a `.sln` file, which contains information about the projects and their configurations.
