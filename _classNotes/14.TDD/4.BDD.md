# BDD
- BDD is a software development process that emphasizes collaboration between developers, testers, and business stakeholders to ensure that software meets the needs of its users.

## Concepts
- **User Stories**: BDD starts with user stories, which are short descriptions of a feature from the perspective of the end user. They typically follow the format: "As a [type of user], I want [some goal] so that [some reason]."
- **Scenarios**: Each user story is broken down into scenarios, which are specific examples of how the feature should work. Scenarios are written in a Given-When-Then format:
  - **Given**: the initial context or state of the system (similar to the Arrange step in TDD)
  - **When**: the action or event that triggers the behavior (same as the Act step in TDD)
  - **Then**: the expected outcome or result (similar to the Assert step in TDD)

## Example
```csharp
// User Story: As a user, I want to be able to create a new client account so that I can access the services provided by the application.
// Scenario: Creating a new client account
Given I am on the registration page
When I enter valid information and submit the form with the following details:
  | Field       | Value              |
  |-------------|--------------------|
  | First Name  | John               |
  | Last Name   | Doe                |
  | Email       | john.doe@email.com |
  | Password    | SecurePass123      |
And I click the "Register" button
Then a new client account should be created and I should be redirected to the dashboard
And I should see a welcome message with my name "John"
