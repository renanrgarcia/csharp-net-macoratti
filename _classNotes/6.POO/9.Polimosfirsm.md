# Polimorfism

- Polimorfism is a concept in OOP that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It is achieved through method overriding and interfaces.
- Syntax:

```csharp
public class Shape
{
    public virtual void Draw()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Drawing a shape");
    }

    public void Resize()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Resizing a shape");
    }

    public void Resize(int width, int height)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Resizing a shape to {width}x{height}");
    }
}

public class Circle : Shape
{
    public override void Draw()
    {
        base.Draw(); // Calls the base class method
        Console.WriteLine("Drawing a circle");
    }
}

public class Square : Shape
{
    public override void Draw()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Drawing a square");
    }
}

// Overloading
Shape shape1 = new Circle();
Shape shape2 = new Square();
shape1.Draw(); // Output: Drawing a shape \n Drawing a circle
shape2.Draw(); // Output: Drawing a square

// Overriding
shape1.Resize(); // Output: Resizing a shape
shape1.Resize(10, 20); // Output: Resizing a shape to 10x20
```

## Compilation Time Polymorphism (Overloading)

- This type of polymorphism is resolved at compile time. It occurs when multiple methods have the same name but different parameters (method overloading). The compiler determines which method to call based on the number and type of arguments passed.
- Example:

```csharp
public class MathOperations
{
    public int Add(int a, int b)
    {
        return a + b;
    }

    public double Add(double a, double b)
    {
        return a + b;
    }
}
```

## Runtime Polymorphism (Overriding)

- This type of polymorphism is resolved at runtime. It occurs when a derived class overrides a method of its base class. The method to be called is determined at runtime based on the object type.
- Example:

```csharp
public class Animal
{
    public virtual void Speak()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Animal speaks");
    }
}

public class Dog : Animal
{
    public override void Speak()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Dog barks");
    }
}
```
