# POO

- The world is made up of objects, and the object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm is based on this concept.
- Objects exchanges messages with each other to perform tasks.
- Benefits of OOP:
  - Code is reusable.
  - Code is easy to maintain.
  - Code is easy to understand.
  - Code is easy to integrate with other systems.
  - Code is easy to test.
- `Objects` are structures that contain data and methods to manipulate that data.
- `Classes` are blueprints for creating objects.

## Procedural programming

- Problems:
  - Maintenance is difficult.
  - Hard to change functionalities without affecting other parts of the code.
  - Code is not reusable with few return on investment.
  - Programs not suitable for teams, but for individuals.
  - Hard to translate business models into programming models.
  - Integration with other systems was caotic.

## Abstraction

- Abstraction is the process of hiding the implementation details and showing only the essential features of the object.

## Encapsulation

- Encapsulation is the process of wrapping the data and the methods that operate on the data into a single unit called a class.
- The object must be able to control the access to its data and methods.

## Inheritance

- Inheritance is the process of creating a new class from an existing class.
- The new class inherits the properties and methods of the existing class.
- `Base class` is the class that is inherited from.
- `Derived class` is the class that inherits from the base class.

## Polymorphism

- Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms.
- It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.
- It is the ability to call the same method on different objects and have each object respond in its own way.
