# Composition

- Composition is a design principle in object-oriented programming that allows you to build complex types by combining objects of other types.
  - It is a `has-a` relationship, meaning that one class contains or is composed of other classes.
- The container class is responsible for the lifecycle of the contained objects.
  - This means that if the container class is destroyed, the contained objects are also destroyed.
  - The contained objects cannot exist independently of the container class.
- The father class is the class that contains the other classes. The child classes are the classes that are contained within the father class.
- Represents a all - part relationship. It means that the child class is a part of the father class.
  - One part-object can be contained in only one whole-object.
- Syntax:

```csharp
public class FatherClass
{
    private ChildClass child;

    public FatherClass()
    {
        child = new ChildClass();
    }
}
```

- Example:

```csharp
public class House // This way we can choose what to implement from the classes we want to use
{
    private readonly Room room;
    private readonly Garage garage;

    public House()
    {
        room = new Room();
        garage = new Garage();
    }
}

public class Room
{
    // Room properties and methods
}

public class Garage
{
    // Garage properties and methods
}
```

## Aggregation

- Aggregation is a special type of composition where the contained objects can exist independently of the container class.
  - The difference is that the contained objects can be shared among multiple container classes.
  - The part-object can exist independently of the whole-object.
- It is a weaker relationship than composition.
- Example:

```csharp
public class School // Even though the school has students, the students can exist independently of the school.
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    private readonly List<Professor> professors;

    public School()
    {
        professors = new List<Professor>();
    }

    public void AddProfessor(Professor professor)
    {
        professors.Add(professor);
    }

    public List<Professor> GetProfessors()
    {
        return professors;
    }
}

public class Professor
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string? Subject { get; set; }
}
```

- So, all compositions are aggregations and all aggregations are associations.
