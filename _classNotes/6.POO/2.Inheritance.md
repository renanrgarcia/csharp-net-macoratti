# Inheritance

- On C#, we can create a new class from an existing class using the `:` operator.
- We only can inherit from one class at a time (single inheritance). But we can define inheritance hierarchies, where a class can inherit from another class, which in turn can inherit from another class, and so on.
- Syntax:

```csharp
class DerivedClass : BaseClass
{
    // Class members
}
```

- The derived class inherits all the members (fields, properties, methods, etc.) of the base class.
- Example:

```csharp
class Person
{
    public string? Name { get; set; }
    public string? Email { get; set; }
    public void ShowInfo()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Name: {Name}, Email: {Email}");
    }
}

class Student : Person // Relationship: "is a"
{
    public string? Course { get; set; }
    public int Grade { get; set; }
}

class Teacher : Person
{
    public string? Subject { get; set; }
    public int Salary { get; set; }
}
```

## Benefits of inheritance

- `Code reusability`: We can reuse the code of the base class in the derived class.
- `Specialization`: We can create specialized classes that inherit from a base class and add new functionality or override existing functionality.
- `Extensibility`: We can create new classes that inherit from existing classes and add new functionality without modifying the existing classes.
- `Polymorphism`: We can use inheritance to create a common interface for different classes, allowing us to treat objects of different classes as objects of a common superclass.
- `Encapsulation`: We can use inheritance to encapsulate the implementation details of a class and expose only the necessary members to the derived classes. We can use access modifiers to control the visibility of members in the base class and derived classes.

## Problems with inheritance

- `Tight coupling`: Inheritance creates a tight coupling between the base class and the derived class, making it difficult to change the implementation of the base class without affecting the derived classes.
- `Deep inheritance hierarchies`: Deep inheritance hierarchies can make the code difficult to understand and maintain. It can also lead to the "fragile base class" problem, where changes to the base class can break the derived classes.
- `Inheritance vs. composition`: Inheritance is not always the best solution for code reuse. In some cases, composition (using objects of other classes as members of a class) may be a better solution. Composition allows for more flexibility and less coupling between classes.
- `Rigid design`: Inheritance can lead to a rigid design where the base class is too general and the derived classes are too specific. This can make it difficult to add new functionality or change the behavior of the classes.

## Protected modifier

- The `protected` modifier allows a member to be accessed only by the class itself and by derived classes. It is used to restrict access to members of a class to only the class and its derived classes.

## Using constructors in inheritance

- When a derived class is created, the constructor of the base class is called first, followed by the constructor of the derived class. This ensures that the base class is properly initialized before the derived class is initialized.
- The constructor of the base class can be called explicitly using the `base` keyword. This is useful when the base class has a constructor that takes parameters and we want to pass values to it from the derived class.

```csharp
class Person
{
    public string? Name { get; set; }
    public string? Email { get; set; }

    public Person(string name, string email)
    {
        Name = name;
        Email = email;
    }
}

class Student : Person
{
    public string? Course { get; set; }
    public int Grade { get; set; }

    // Constructor of the derived class
    public Student(string name, string email, string course, int grade) : base(name, email)
    {
        Course = course;
        Grade = grade;
    }
}
```
