# Inheritance

- Inheritance is "is a" relationship between classes. Meaning: derived classes inherit from base classes. The derived class is a specialized version of the base class.

## Class Diagram

- To install on Visual Studio, go to Visual Studio Installer > Individual Components > Code tools > Class Designer.
- On Visual Studio, we can create a class diagram by right-clicking on the project and selecting "Add" > "New Item..." > "Class Diagram".

# Inheritance Types

## Single Inheritance

- A class can inherit from only one base class. This is the most common type of inheritance in C#.
- Example:

```csharp
class Person
{
    public string? Name { get; set; }
    public int Age { get; set; }
}

class Student : Person // Student is a Person
{
    public string? Course { get; set; }
}
```

## Hierarchical Inheritance

- A class can have multiple derived classes. This is useful when we want to create a class hierarchy where a base class has multiple specialized versions.
- Example:

```csharp
class Person
{
  public string? Name { get; set; }
  public int Age { get; set; }
}

class Student : Person // Student is a Person
{
  public string? Course { get; set; }
}

class Teacher : Person // Teacher is a Person
{
  public string? Subject { get; set; }
}
```

## Multilevel Inheritance

- A class can inherit from another derived class. This is useful when we want to create a class hierarchy where a base class has multiple levels of specialization.

- Example:

```csharp
class Person
{
  public string? Name { get; set; }
  public int Age { get; set; }
}

class Student : Person // Student is a Person
{
  public string? Course { get; set; }
}

class GraduateStudent : Student // GraduateStudent is a Student
{
  public string? Thesis { get; set; }
}
```

## Multiple Inheritance

- C# does not support multiple inheritance for classes. This means that a class cannot inherit from more than one base class. However, a class can implement multiple interfaces, allowing it to inherit members from multiple sources.
- In the example below, `TeamLead` inherits from `Person` and implements both `IEmployee` and `IManager` interfaces.

```csharp
interface IEmployee
{
  decimal CalculateSalary();
  string Department { get; set; }
}

interface IManager
{
  List<string> GetSubordinates();
  int TeamSize { get; set; }
}

class Person
{
  public string? Name { get; set; }
  public int Age { get; set; }
}

class TeamLead : Person, IEmployee, IManager // TeamLead is a Person and implements IEmployee and IManager
{
  public string Department { get; set; }
  public int TeamSize { get; set; }

  public decimal CalculateSalary()
  {
    return 5000m + (TeamSize * 100m);
  }

  public List<string> GetSubordinates()
  {
    // Implementation here
    return new List<string>();
  }
}
```

# Upcasting and Downcasting

- `Upcasting` is the process of converting a derived class reference to a base class reference. This is done implicitly in C#.
- Example:

```csharp
class Person
{
  public string? Name { get; set; }
  public int Age { get; set; }

  public virtual void Greeting() => Console.WriteLine($"Hello, my name is {Name}");
}

class Student : Person // Student is a Person
{
  public string? Course { get; set; }

  public override void Greeting() => Console.WriteLine($"Hello, my name is {Name} and I am studying {Course}");
}

// Upcasting
Student student = new Student { Name = "John", Course = "Math" };
Person person = student; // Upcasting
person.Greeting(); // Output: Hello, my name is John and I am studying Math
```

- But the base class reference cannot access the derived class members directly. We need to cast it back to the derived class type to access the derived class members.
- `Downcasting` is the process of converting a base class reference to a derived class reference. This is done explicitly in C# using casting. However, we need to be careful when downcasting, as it can lead to runtime exceptions if the object is not of the expected type.
- Example:

```csharp
class Person
{
  public string? Name { get; set; }
  public int Age { get; set; }

  public virtual void Greeting() => Console.WriteLine($"Hello, my name is {Name}");
}

class Student : Person // Student is a Person
{
  public string? Course { get; set; }

  public override void Greeting() => Console.WriteLine($"Hello, my name is {Name} and I am studying {Course}");
}

// Downcasting
Person person = new Student { Name = "John", Course = "Math" };
Student student = (Student)person; // Downcasting
student.Course = "Physics"; // Now we can access the Course property
Console.WriteLine(student.Course); // Output: Physics
```
