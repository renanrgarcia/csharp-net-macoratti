# Inheritance II

## Class Object

- In C#, all classes are derived from the `Object` class, which is the base class for all classes in C#. The `Object` class provides a set of methods that are common to all objects, such as `ToString()`, `Equals()`, `GetType()` and `GetHashCode()`. When we create a new class, it automatically inherits from the `Object` class, even if we don't explicitly specify it.
- Using interfaces, we can have multiple inheritance in C#.
  - A class can implement multiple interfaces, allowing it to inherit members from multiple sources. This is useful when we want to create a class that has functionality from multiple sources without creating a complex inheritance hierarchy.

## new modifier

- The `new` modifier is used to indicate that we are intentionally hiding a member of the base class. If we don't use the `new` modifier, the compiler will issue a warning indicating that we are hiding a member of the base class without using the `new` modifier.
- Example:

```csharp
class Person
{
    public string? Name { get; set; }

    public void Greeting() => Console.WriteLine($"Hello, my name is {Name}");
}

class Student : Person
{
    public string? Course { get; set; }

    public new void Greeting() => Console.WriteLine($"Hello, my name is {Name} and I am studying {Course}");
}
```

## Virtual and override modifiers

- The `virtual` modifier is used to indicate that a method can be overridden in a derived class.
- The `override` modifier is used to indicate that a method is overriding a virtual method in the base class.
- Example:

```csharp
class Person
{
    public string? Name { get; set; }

    public virtual void Greeting() => Console.WriteLine($"Hello, my name is {Name}");
}

class Student : Person
{
    public string? Course { get; set; }

    public override void Greeting() => Console.WriteLine($"Hello, my name is {Name} and I am studying {Course}");
}
```

- The difference between `new` and `override` is that `new` hides the base class member, while `override` replaces the base class member with the derived class member.
  - This means that if we call the method on a base class reference, it will call the base class method, while if we call the method on a derived class reference, it will call the derived class method.

## Sealed modifier

- The `sealed` modifier is used to indicate that a class cannot be inherited from.
  - This is useful when we want to prevent further inheritance from a class, either for security reasons or to prevent the class from being modified in unexpected ways.
- Example:

```csharp
sealed class FinalClass
{
  public void Method() => Console.WriteLine("This method cannot be overridden");
}

// This will cause a compilation error
// class DerivedClass : FinalClass
// {
//     // Cannot inherit from sealed class 'FinalClass'
// }
```

- We can also seal specific methods to prevent overriding:

```csharp
class BaseClass
{
  public virtual void Method1() => Console.WriteLine("BaseClass.Method1");

  public virtual void Method2() => Console.WriteLine("BaseClass.Method2");
}

class DerivedClass : BaseClass
{
  public sealed override void Method1() => Console.WriteLine("DerivedClass.Method1");

  public override void Method2() => Console.WriteLine("DerivedClass.Method2");
}

class FurtherDerivedClass : DerivedClass
{
  // This will cause a compilation error
  // public override void Method1() => Console.WriteLine("FurtherDerivedClass.Method1");

  // This is allowed
  public override void Method2() => Console.WriteLine("FurtherDerivedClass.Method2");
}
```
