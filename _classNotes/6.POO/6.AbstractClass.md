# Abstract modifier

- The `abstract` modifier is used to indicate that a class or method is incomplete and must be implemented in a derived class.
- Abstract classes cannot be instantiated directly, and they can contain abstract methods that must be implemented in derived classes.
  - Can contain both abstract and non-abstract methods.
  - Is virtual by default.
- Example:

```csharp
abstract class Shape // Abstract class
{
  public string Color { get; set; }
  public int X { get; set; }
  public int Y { get; set; }

  public abstract double Area(); // Abstract method, must be implemented in derived classes
  public virtual void Display() => Console.WriteLine($"This is a {Color} shape at ({X},{Y})"); // Virtual method, can be overridden in derived classes
  public void Draw() => Console.WriteLine("Drawing a shape"); // Non-abstract method
}

class Circle : Shape // Derived class
{
  public double Radius { get; set; }

  public override double Area() => Math.PI * Radius * Radius; // Implementing abstract method

  public override void Display() // Overriding virtual method
  {
    base.Display(); // Call base class method
    Console.WriteLine($"This is a circle with radius {Radius} and area {Area()}");
  }
}
```
