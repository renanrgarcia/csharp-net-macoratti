# As Operator

- The `as` operator is used to perform safe type casting in C#. It attempts to cast an object to a specified type and returns null if the cast fails, instead of throwing an exception.
- It returns the object as the specified type if the cast is successful, or null if it fails.
  - Used to reference or nullable types.
- Example:

```csharp
// Invalid casting
Object carObject = new Car();
try
{
    var x = (string)carObject; // This will throw an InvalidCastException
}
catch (InvalidCastException e)
{
    Console.WriteLine(e.Message); // Output: Unable to cast object of type 'Car' to type 'System.String'.
}

// Using the 'as' operator
Object carObject = new Car();
var x = carObject as string; // This will not throw an exception, x will be null
if (x is not null) Console.WriteLine("Converted to string: " + x);
else Console.WriteLine("Conversion failed, x is null"); // Output: Conversion failed, x is null
```

- Use case: upcasting and downcasting.

```csharp
Circle circle = new Circle();
Shape shape = circle; // Upcasting

// Circle c = (Circle)shape; // Downcasting, but it can throw an exception if shape is not a Circle
Circle c = shape as Circle; // Safe downcasting using 'as'

if (c is not null) Console.WriteLine("Downcasting successful"); // Output: Downcasting successful
else Console.WriteLine("Downcasting failed, c is null"); // This won't be executed
```

# Is Operator

- The `is` operator is used to check if an object is of a specific type. It returns true if the object is of the specified type, and false otherwise.
- It can also be used to check if an object is of a nullable type.
- Example:

```csharp
Object carObject = new Car();
if (carObject is Car car) // Check if carObject is of type Car
{
    Console.WriteLine("carObject is a Car"); // Output: carObject is a Car
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("carObject is not a Car");
}
```

## Using as and is together

- You can use the `as` operator to cast an object and then check if the cast was successful using the `is` operator.
  - Elvis operator `?.` can be used to check if the object is null before accessing its members.
- Example:

```csharp
Object carObject = new Car();
var car = carObject as Car; // Attempt to cast carObject to Car
if (car is not null) // Check if cast was successful
{
  Console.WriteLine("carObject is a Car"); // Output: carObject is a Car
  Console.WriteLine(car.GetType().Name); // Output: Car
}
else
{
  Console.WriteLine("carObject is not a Car");
}

// Alternatively, using is and as together:
if (carObject is Car) // Check type first
{
  var myCar = carObject as Car; // Safe cast
  Console.WriteLine(myCar?.GetType().Name); // Output: Car
}
```
