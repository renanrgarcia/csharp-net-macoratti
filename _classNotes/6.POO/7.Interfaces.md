# Interfaces

- An interface is a contract that defines a set of methods and properties that a class must implement. It allows for polymorphism, where different classes can be treated as the same type if they implement the same interface.
- From C# 8.0, interfaces can have default implementations for methods. The default implementation is provided in the interface itself, and classes that implement the interface can choose to override it or use the default implementation.
- From C# 11.0, interfaces can have static members. This allows for defining static methods and properties that are associated with the interface itself, rather than with a specific implementation of the interface.
- Interfaces members are public by default, and cannot have access modifiers.
- Classes or structs can implement multiple interfaces, allowing for a form of multiple inheritance.
- Syntax:

```csharp
public interface IMyInterface
{
    // Method signature
    void MyMethod();

    // Property signature
    int MyProperty { get; set; }

    // Indexer signature
    int this[int index] { get; set; }

    // Event signature
    event EventHandler MyEvent;

    // Concrete method (C# 8.0 and later)
    void MyConcreteMethod()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("This is a concrete method in the interface.");
    }
}

public interface IMySecondInterface
{
    // Method signature
    void MySecondMethod();
}

// Implementing
public class MyClass : IMyInterface, IMySecondInterface
{
    // Implementing the method from IMyInterface
    public void MyMethod()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("MyMethod implementation");
    }

    // Implementing the property from IMyInterface
    public int MyProperty { get; set; }

    // Implementing the indexer from IMyInterface
    public int this[int index]
    {
        get { return index; }
        set { /* Set logic */ }
    }

    // Implementing the event from IMyInterface
    public event EventHandler MyEvent;

    // Implementing the method from IMySecondInterface
    public void MySecondMethod()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("MySecondMethod implementation");
    }
}

// Instantiating and using the class
IMyInterface myInterface = new MyClass();
myInterface.MyConcreteMethod(); // Output: This is a concrete method in the interface.
```
