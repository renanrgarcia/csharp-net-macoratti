# Partial Class

- Partial classes allow you to split the definition of a class, struct, or interface across multiple files. This can be useful for organizing large classes or for separating auto-generated code from user-defined code.
- Partial classes are defined using the `partial` keyword in the class definition.
- Each part of the partial class can contain methods, properties, fields, and other members.
- The compiler combines all parts of the partial class into a single class at compile time.
- They also can be defined in different files, which can be useful for separating auto-generated code from user-defined code.
- Syntax:

```csharp
public partial class ClassName
{
    // Members of the partial class
}

public partial class ClassName
{
    // Additional members of the partial class
}

// Example:
public partial class Person
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
}

public partial class Person
{
    public int Age { get; set; }
}

// Usage:
var person = new Person
{
    Name = "John",
    Age = 30
};
Console.WriteLine($"Name: {person.Name}, Age: {person.Age}");
```

## Rules for Partial Classes

- All parts of a partial class must be defined in the same assembly and namespace.
- All parts of a partial class must have the same access modifier (e.g., `public`, `private`, etc.).
- If any part of a partial class is marked as `abstract`, then all parts must be marked as `abstract`.
- The modifier `partial` must come before the `class`, `struct`, or `interface` keyword.
- Nested partial are allowed.
- The attributes and characteristics applied to the partial class are applied to the entire class.
