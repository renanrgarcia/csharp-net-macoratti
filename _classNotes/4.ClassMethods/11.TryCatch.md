# Try-catch blocks

- Try-catch blocks are used to handle exceptions in a controlled manner.
- Syntax:

```csharp
try
{
    // Code that may throw an exception
}
catch (ExceptionType ex)
{
    // Code to handle the exception
}
finally
{
    // Code that will always execute
}
```

## Exception properties

- `Message`: A message that describes the error.
- `StackTrace`: A string representation of the immediate frames on the call stack.
- `InnerException` (Exception): The exception that is the cause of the current exception.
