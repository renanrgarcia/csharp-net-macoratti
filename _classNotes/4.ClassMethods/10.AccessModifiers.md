# Access modifiers

- `public`: The member is accessible from any other code in the same assembly or another assembly that references it.
- `private`: The member is accessible only within its own class.
- `protected`: The member is accessible within its own class and by derived classes.
- `internal`: The member is accessible only within its own assembly.
- `file`: The member is accessible only within the same file.

## Access Levels

| Access Modifier      | Class | Assembly | Derived Class (same assembly) | Derived Class (different assembly) | Outside Code |

| `public`             | Yes   | Yes      | Yes                           | Yes                                | Yes          |

\* Only within the same source file

- It's a good practice to use the most restrictive access modifier that makes sense for your code. This helps to encapsulate the implementation details and reduce the risk of unintended interactions between different parts of your code.

## Resources default access modifier

- **Structs**: `internal` (accessible only within the same assembly)
- **Interfaces**: `internal` (accessible only within the same assembly)
- **Enums**: `internal` (accessible only within the same assembly)
- **Methods, Properties, Fields**: `private` (accessible only within the same class)
