# Structs

- Structs are a way to group related data together in a single unit.
- They are similar to classes but have some differences in behavior and usage.
- Structs are value types stored on the stack, while classes are reference types stored on the heap.
  - Use structs for small, lightweight data structures that benefit from value semantics.
  - Ideal for representing simple data values that should be copied rather than referenced.
  - Best for immutable data where instances with the same values should be considered equal.
- Syntax:

```csharp
struct StructName
{
    // Fields
    public int Field1;
    public string Field2;

    // Constructor
    public StructName(int field1, string field2)
    {
        Field1 = field1;
        Field2 = field2;
    }

    // Method
    public void Display()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Field1: {Field1}, Field2: {Field2}");
    }
}
```

- Example:

```csharp
struct Point
{
    public int X;
    public int Y;

    public Point(int x, int y)
    {
        X = x;
        Y = y;
    }

    public void Display()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Point: ({X}, {Y})");
    }
}
```

## Structs vs Classes

- Structs are value types, meaning they are stored on the stack and copied when passed around, while classes are reference types and stored on the heap.
- Structs do not support inheritance, while classes do.
- Structs can implement interfaces, but they cannot inherit from other structs or classes.
- Structs have a default constructor that initializes all fields to their default values, while classes do not have a default constructor unless explicitly defined.

- Example:

```csharp
// Example showing the difference between struct and class behavior
// Struct example (value type - stored on stack)
struct Point
{
  public int X;
  public int Y;

  public Point(int x, int y)
  {
    X = x;
    Y = y;
  }
}

// Class example (reference type - stored on heap)
class PointClass
{
  public int X;
  public int Y;

  public PointClass(int x, int y)
  {
    X = x;
    Y = y;
  }
}

class Program
{
  static void Main(string[] args)
  {
    // Struct behavior (value type)
    Console.WriteLine("STRUCT BEHAVIOR (stack):");
    Point p1 = new Point(10, 20);
    Point p2 = p1; // Creates a copy of the values

    p2.X = 30; // Modifies only p2

    Console.WriteLine($"p1: ({p1.X}, {p1.Y})"); // Output: p1: (10, 20)
    Console.WriteLine($"p2: ({p2.X}, {p2.Y})"); // Output: p2: (30, 20)

    // Class behavior (reference type)
    Console.WriteLine("\nCLASS BEHAVIOR (heap):");
    PointClass pc1 = new PointClass(10, 20);
    PointClass pc2 = pc1; // Creates a reference to the same object

    pc2.X = 30; // Modifies the object that both variables reference

    Console.WriteLine($"pc1: ({pc1.X}, {pc1.Y})"); // Output: pc1: (30, 20)
    Console.WriteLine($"pc2: ({pc2.X}, {pc2.Y})"); // Output: pc2: (30, 20)
  }
}
```
