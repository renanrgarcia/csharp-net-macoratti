# Anonymous Types

- Anonymous types are a feature in C# that allows you to create an object without explicitly defining a class for it.
- This is useful for creating simple data structures on the fly, especially when you need to return multiple values from a method or when you want to group related data together without creating a separate class.
- They inherit from `System.Object` and are created using the `new` keyword followed by an object initializer.
- Syntax:

```csharp
var anonymousObject = new { Property1 = value1, Property2 = value2 };
```

- Anonymous types are immutable, meaning that once they are created, their properties cannot be changed.
- Anonymous types are typically used in LINQ queries to project data into a new shape.
- They are defined using the `var` keyword, and the compiler infers the type based on the properties you define.
- Example:

```csharp
var anonymousPerson = new { Name = "John", Age = 30 };
Console.WriteLine($"Name: {anonymousPerson.Name}, Age: {anonymousPerson.Age}");
```

- Example with LINQ:

```csharp
var people = new List<Person>
{
    new Person { Name = "Alice", Age = 25 },
    new Person { Name = "Bob", Age = 30 }
};

var anonymousPeople = people.Select(p => new { p.Name, p.Age });
foreach (var person in anonymousPeople)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Name: {person.Name}, Age: {person.Age}");
}
```

- Example with anonymous types inside of another anonymous type and using arrays:

```csharp
var anonymousPerson = new
{  Id = 1,
   PersonalInfo = new {
      Name = "John",
      Age = 30,
      Hobbies = new[] {
        "Reading",
        "Gaming"
        }
      }
};

Console.WriteLine($"Id: {anonymousPerson.Id}, Name: {anonymousPerson.PersonalInfo.Name}, Age: {anonymousPerson.PersonalInfo.Age}, Hobbies: {string.Join(", ", anonymousPerson.PersonalInfo.Hobbies)}");
```
