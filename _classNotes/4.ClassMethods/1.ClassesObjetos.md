# Classes

- Classes are a way to bundle data and functionality together.
- Example:

```csharp
class Car
{
    // Fields (attributes)
    public string? Make;
    public string? Model;
    public int Year;

    // Method (functionality)
    public void Start()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Car started.");
    }
}

// Usage
Car myCar = new Car();
myCar.Make = "Toyota";
myCar.Model = "Corolla";
myCar.Year = 2020;
```

## Memory allocation

- Classes are reference types, meaning they are stored in the heap memory.
  - Value types are stored in the stack memory.
- On the example above, `myCar` is a created on the stack, but the object it points to is created on the heap.
  - If `myCar` is initialized to `null`, it will not point to any object in the heap. It's just a variable on the stack.
  - After the assignment, `myCar` points to the object in the heap, and the object is created in the heap memory.
- If I instance a `myCar2` equal to `myCar`, both will point to the same object in the heap. If I change a property of `myCar2`, it will also change the property of `myCar`.
- If I create a new object and assign it to `myCar2`, it will point to a different object in the heap, and `myCar` will still point to the original object.

## Object

- An object is an instance of a class.
- An object is created from a class and contains data and methods defined in that class.
- `var myCar = new Car();` creates an object of the `Car` class.
  - Or `Car myCar = new();` after C# 10.0.
