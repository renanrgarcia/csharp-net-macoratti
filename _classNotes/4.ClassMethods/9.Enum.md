# Enum

- Enum is a class method that allows you to define a set of named values for a class. It is used to create enumerations, which are a way to define a set of related constants.
- Can be used directly within a namespace or inside a class/struct. It's a value type, so it's stored on the stack.
- Values assigned to enum members are of type `int` by default, starting from 0 and incrementing by 1 for each subsequent member.
- Syntax:

```csharp
enum EnumName
{
    Value1,
    Value2,
    Value3,
    ...
}

enum EnumWithValues
{
    Value1 = 1,
    Value2 = 2,
    Value3 = 3,
    ...
}

enum CustomValues
{
    Value1, // 0
    Value2, // 1
    Value3 = 5,
    Value4, // 6
    Value5, // 7
    ...
}
```

- To access the enum values, you can use the enum name followed by the dot operator and the value name. For example: `EnumName.Value1`.
  - To get the underlying value of an enum, you can cast it to its underlying type (usually `int`). For example: `(int)EnumName.Value1`.

## Different Types of Enums

- We can define enums with different underlying types, such as `byte`, `short`, `long`, etc.
- Syntax:

```csharp
enum EnumName : byte
{
    Value1,
    Value2,
    Value3,
    ...
}
```

- To retrieve the underlying type of an enum, we can cast it to the desired type. For example:

```csharp
enum EnumName : byte
{
    Value1 = 1,
    Value2 = 2,
    Value3 = 3,
    ...
}

byte value = (byte)EnumName.Value1; // Cast to byte
Console.WriteLine(value); // Output: 1
```
