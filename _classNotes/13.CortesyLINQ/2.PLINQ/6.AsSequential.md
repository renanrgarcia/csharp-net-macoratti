# AsSequential

```csharp
var stopwatch = new Stopwatch.StartNew();

ConcurrentDictionary<int, List<int>> threadsMap = [];

var numbers = ParallelEnumerable.Range(0, 10)
    .WithDegreeOfParallelism(2)
    .AsSequential() // This is the opposite of Parallel, it forces the query to be executed sequentially
    .Select(HeavyComputation);

foreach (var n in numbers)
{
    n.Dump();
}
// Output:
// 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
// But in this case the time taken will be longer than the sequential version because it is executed in parallel but then forced to be sequential.

stopwatch.Stop();
stopwatch.ElapsedMiliseconds
    .Dump("Execution Time");

threadsMap
    .Dump("Threads Map");

int HeavyComputation(int i)
{
    var originalN = n;
    threadsMap.AddOrUpdate(
        Environment.CurrentManagedThreadId,
        addValue: [n],
        updateValueFactory: (key, values) => [.. values, n]);

    for (int i = 0; i < 100_000_000; i++)
    {
        n += i;
    }

    return originalN;
}
```

- Another example is to use `AsSequential` to convert a parallel query back to a sequential one, which can be useful when you want to ensure that the results are processed in the order they were produced, even if the query was initially executed in parallel.

```csharp
var numbers = ParallelEnumerable.Range(0, 10)
    .AsParallel() // This is better for tasks that are optimized for parallel execution, eg: CPU-bound tasks like complex calculations
    .Select(HeavyComputation)
    .AsSequential() // This is better for tasks that are optimized for sequential execution, eg: IO-bound tasks like database queries
    .Select(AnotherComputation);
```
