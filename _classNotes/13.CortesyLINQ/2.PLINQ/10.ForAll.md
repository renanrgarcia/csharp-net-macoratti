# WithForAll

- The `ForAll` method allows you to perform an action on each element of the query result set.
- This method is useful for scenarios where you want to trigger side effects for each element without collecting the results.
- The action is executed in parallel for each element, and you can use it to update UI elements, log information, or perform other operations.

```csharp
var stopwatch = new Stopwatch.StartNew();

var cts = new CancellationTokenSource();

ConcurrentDictionary<int, List<int>> threadsMap = [];

MyRange(0, 10)
    .AsParallel()
    .WithDegreeOfParallelism(2)
    .Select((i, index) => HeavyComputation(i))
    .ForAll(n =>
    {
        $"Processing {n} on thread {Environment.CurrentManagedThreadId}"
            .Dump();
    }); // This replaces the foreach loop.

stopwatch.Stop();
stopwatch.ElapsedMiliseconds
    .Dump("Execution Time");

threadsMap
    .Dump("Threads Map");

static IEnumerable<int> MyRange(int start, int count)
{
    for (int i = start; i < start + count; i++)
    {
        yield return i;
    }
}
```
