# WithDegreeOfParallelism

- WithDegreeOfParallelism is a method in PLINQ (Parallel LINQ) that allows you to control the degree of parallelism when executing a query.
- This means you can specify the maximum number of concurrent tasks that can be used to process the query.
- By default, PLINQ uses the number of available processors to determine the degree of parallelism, but you can override this behavior using WithDegreeOfParallelism.
- Use `htop` to check the number of available processors on your system. On windows, you can use `Get-Process` in PowerShell to see the number of processors.

## Example

```csharp
var stopwatch = new Stopwatch.StartNew();

// [threadId] => [list of numbers processed by that thread]
// [1] => [1, 2, 3]
ConcurrentDictionary<int, List<int>> threadsMap = [];

var numbers = Enumerable.Range(0, 10)
    .AsParallel()
    .Select(HeavyComputation);

foreach (var _ in numbers);

stopwatch.Stop();
stopwatch.ElapsedMiliseconds
    .Dump("Execution Time");

int HeavyComputation(int i)
{
    threadsMap.AddOrUpdate(
        Environment.CurrentManagedThreadId,
        addValue: [n],
        updateValueFactory: (key, values) => [.. values, n]);

    for (int i = 0; i < 100_000_000; i++)
    {
        n += i;
    }
    return n;
}
```
