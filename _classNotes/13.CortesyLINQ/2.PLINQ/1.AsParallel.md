# AsParallel

- AsParallel is a method in PLINQ (Parallel LINQ) that enables parallel processing of LINQ queries.
- By using AsParallel, you can take advantage of multiple processors or cores to improve the performance of your queries, especially when working with large datasets.
- So, instead of processing elements sequentially, AsParallel allows the query to be executed concurrently across multiple threads.

## Example

Here's a simple example of how to use AsParallel in a LINQ query:

```csharp
var stopwatch = new Stopwatch.StartNew();

var numbers = Enumerable.Range(0, 10)
    .AsParallel()
    .Select(HeavyComputation);

foreach (var _ in numbers); // Force execution of the query

stopwatch.Stop();
stopwatch.ElapsedMiliseconds
    .Dump("Execution Time");
    // Without AsParallel: 2000 ms
    // With AsParallel: 200 ms

int HeavyComputation(int i)
{
    for (int i = 0; i < 100_000_000; i++)
    {
        n += i;
    }
    return n;
}
```

## Considerations

While AsParallel can improve performance, it's essential to consider the following:

1. **Overhead**: Parallelizing a query introduces some overhead. For small datasets or simple operations, the overhead may outweigh the benefits.

2. **Thread Safety**: Ensure that any shared resources accessed within the query are thread-safe to avoid race conditions.

3. **Degree of Parallelism**: You can control the degree of parallelism using the WithDegreeOfParallelism method, allowing you to specify the maximum number of concurrent tasks.

4. **Exceptions**: Exceptions thrown within a parallel query are aggregated and rethrown as AggregateException. Be prepared to handle this in your code.

By using AsParallel judiciously, you can harness the power of parallel processing in your LINQ queries and improve the performance of your applications.
