# Extension Methods

## Summary

This document is divided into sections that explain various LINQ extension methods. Each section focuses on a specific category of methods:

- [Filtering Methods](1.Filtering.md)
  - `Where` | `OfType`
- [Partitioning Methods](2.Partitioning.md)
  - `Skip` | `Take` | `SkipLast` | `TakeLast` | `SkipWhile` | `TakeWhile`
- [Projection Methods](3.Projection.md)
  - `Select` | `Select with Index` | `SelectMany` | `SelectMany with Index` | `Cast` | `Chunk`
- [Existence and Quantity Checking Methods](4.ExistenceAndQuantityChecking.md)
  - `Any` | `All` | `Contains`
- [Sequence Manipulation Methods](5.SequenceManipulation.md)
  - `Append` | `Prepend`
- [Aggregation Methods](6.Aggregation.md)
  - `Count` | `TryGetNonEnumeratedCount` | `Max` | `MaxBy` | `Min` | `MinBy` | `Sum` | `Average` | `LongCount` | `Aggregate`

## Base Concepts

- `Deferred Execution`: The method does not execute until the result is enumerated. This allows for lazy evaluation and can improve performance by avoiding unnecessary computations.
- `Immediate Execution`: The method executes immediately and returns a result. This is useful when you need to force the evaluation of a query or when you want to store the result in a variable. But it can be less efficient if the result is not needed right away.
  - If you need to store the result in a variable, you can use `ToList`, `ToArray`, or `ToDictionary` to force immediate execution. It's important when you want to cache the result or when you need to perform further operations on the result.
