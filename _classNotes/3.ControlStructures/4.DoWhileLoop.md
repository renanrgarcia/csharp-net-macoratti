# Do While Loop

- The `do while` loop is a repetition control structure that executes a block of code at least once and then continues to execute the block as long as a specified condition is true.
  - It's executed at least once before checking the condition.
- Example:

```csharp
do
{
  // Outer loop code
  Console.WriteLine("Outer loop iteration");

  do
  {
    // Nested loop code
    Console.WriteLine("  Nested loop iteration");

    if (someNestedCondition)
    {
      break; // Exit the nested loop if someNestedCondition is met
    }
  } while (nestedCondition);

  if (someCondition)
  {
    break; // Exit the outer loop if someCondition is met
  }
} while (condition);
```
