# For Loop

- The `for` loop is a repetition control structure that allows you to execute a block of code a specific number of times. It consists of three parts: initialization, condition, and increment/decrement.
- Example:

```csharp
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
{
    // Code to execute in each iteration
    Console.WriteLine(i);
}
```

- The `for` loop starts by initializing a variable (`i` in this case) to a starting value (0). It then checks the condition (`i < 10`) before each iteration. If the condition is true, the code block inside the loop is executed. After each iteration, the increment/decrement statement (`i++`) is executed, updating the value of `i`. The loop continues until the condition becomes false.

## Nested For Loop

- You can nest `for` loops inside each other to create multi-dimensional loops.
- Example:

```csharp
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
{
    for (int j = 0; j < 5; j++)
    {
        // Code to execute in each iteration of the inner loop
        Console.WriteLine($"i: {i}, j: {j}");
    }
}
```

## Continue Statement

- The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration.
- Example:

```csharp
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
{
    if (i % 2 == 0)
    {
        continue; // Skip even numbers
    }
    Console.WriteLine(i); // Only odd numbers will be printed
}
```

## Break Statement

- The `break` statement is used to exit a loop prematurely, regardless of the loop's condition.
- Example:

```csharp
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
{
    if (i == 5)
    {
        break; // Exit the loop when i equals 5
    }
    Console.WriteLine(i); // Numbers 0 to 4 will be printed
}
```

## Infinite For Loop

- An infinite `for` loop is a loop that never terminates because its condition is always true. This can happen if the increment/decrement statement is missing or if the condition is always satisfied.
- Example:

```csharp
for (int i = 0; i >= 0; i++)
{
    // This loop will run indefinitely
    Console.WriteLine(i);
}
```

## For Loop with Collections

- You can use a `for` loop to iterate over collections, such as arrays or lists.
- Example:

```csharp
int[] numbers = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
for (int i = 0; i < numbers.Length; i++)
{
    Console.WriteLine(numbers[i]); // Prints each element in the array
}
```

## For Each Loop

- The `foreach` loop is a simplified version of the `for` loop that is specifically designed for iterating over collections, such as arrays or lists. It automatically handles the iteration process, making it easier to read and write.
- Example:

```csharp
int[] numbers = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
foreach (int number in numbers)
{
    Console.WriteLine(number); // Prints each element in the array
}
```
