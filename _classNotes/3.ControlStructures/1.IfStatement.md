# If Statement

- The `if` statement is a control structure that allows you to execute a block of code conditionally based on a boolean expression.
- Ex:

```csharp
if (condition)
{
    // Code to execute if condition is true
}
```

## If-Else Statement

- The `if-else` statement allows you to execute one block of code if the condition is true and another block of code if the condition is false.
- Ex:

```csharp
if (condition)
{
    // Code to execute if condition is true
}
else
{
    // Code to execute if condition is false
}
```

## If-Else-If Statement

- The `if-else-if` statement allows you to check multiple conditions in sequence.
- Ex:

```csharp
if (condition1)
{
    // Code to execute if condition1 is true
}
else if (condition2)
{
    // Code to execute if condition2 is true
}
else
{
    // Code to execute if both conditions are false
}
```
