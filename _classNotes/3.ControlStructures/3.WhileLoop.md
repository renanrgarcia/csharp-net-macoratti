# Repetition Control Structures

- Repetition control structures are used to execute a block of code multiple times based on a condition.
- Rudimentary repetition control structure example with `goto` and `label`:

```csharp
label:
    // Code to execute
    if (condition)
        goto label; // Jumps back to the label, creating an infinite loop
```

# While Loop

- The `while` loop is a repetition control structure that executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
- Ex:

```csharp
while (condition)
{
  // Code to execute while condition is true

  if (exitCondition)
  {
    break; // Exits the loop when exitCondition is true
  }

  // Nested while loop
  while (nestedCondition)
  {
    // Code to execute while nestedCondition is true

    if (nestedExitCondition)
    {
      break; // Exits the nested loop when nestedExitCondition is true
    }
  }
}
```

- The condition is evaluated before each iteration of the loop. If the condition is true, the code block inside the loop is executed. If the condition is false, the loop terminates and control moves to the next statement after the loop.
