# Directory and DirectoryInfo

- Directory and DirectoryInfo are classes in the `System.IO` namespace that provide methods for working with directories in the file system.
- They allow you to create, delete, move, and enumerate directories and their contents.
- `Directory` is a static class that provides methods for working with directories.
- `DirectoryInfo` is an instance class that provides instance methods for working with directories.
- So, you can use `Directory` for simple operations and `DirectoryInfo` for more complex operations that require an instance of a directory.

## Directory Class

### Methods

- `CreateDirectory(string path)`: Creates all directories and subdirectories in the specified path.
- `Delete(string path)`: Deletes the specified directory.
- `Exists(string path)`: Determines whether the specified directory exists.
- `GetDirectories(string path, SearchOption? searchOption)`: Gets the subdirectories in the specified directory.
- `GetFiles(string path)`: Gets the files in the specified directory.
- `GetParent(string path)`: Gets the parent directory of the specified path.
- `GetCreationTime(string path)`: Gets the creation time of the specified directory.
- `Move(string sourceDirName, string destDirName)`: Moves a directory and its contents to a new location.

### Exceptions

- `DirectoryNotFoundException`: Thrown when the specified directory does not exist.
- `UnauthorizedAccessException`: Thrown when the caller does not have the required permission to access the directory.
- `PathTooLongException`: Thrown when the specified path, file name, or both exceed the system-defined maximum length.
- `NotSupportedException`: Thrown when the specified path is in an invalid format.
- `SecurityException`: Thrown when the caller does not have the required permission to access the directory.
- `ArgumentException`: Thrown when the specified path is invalid, such as being empty or containing invalid characters.
