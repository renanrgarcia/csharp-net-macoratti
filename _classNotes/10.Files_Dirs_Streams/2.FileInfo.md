# FileInfo

- Belongs to the `System.IO` namespace.
- Different from the `File` class, which provides static methods, `FileInfo` is an instance class that represents a file and provides instance methods for creating, copying, deleting, moving, and opening files.
- When the properties are accessed for the first time, FileInfo calls `Refresh` and caches the values. On subsequent accesses, it uses the cached values.

## Properties

- `Name`: Gets the name of the file, including the extension.
- `Directory`: Gets the directory information for the file.
- `DirectoryName`: Gets the full path of the directory that contains the file.
- `Exists`: Gets a value indicating whether the file exists.
- `Length`: Gets the size of the file in bytes.
- `IsReadOnly`: Gets a value indicating whether the file is read-only.

## Methods

- `CopyTo(string destFileName)`: Copies the file to a new location.
- `Decrypt()`: Decrypts the file.
- `Crypt()`: Encrypts the file.
- `Delete()`: Deletes the file.
- `GetAccessControl()`: Gets the access control list (ACL) entries for the file.
- `MoveTo(string destFileName)`: Moves the file to a new location.
- `Replace(string destinationFileName, string destinationBackupFileName)`: Replaces the contents of the file with the contents of another file, and creates a backup of the original file.
- `ToString()`: Returns a string that represents the current file.

- `Open()`: Opens the file.
- `OpenRead()`: Creates a FileStream read-only.
- `OpenWrite()`: Creates a FileStream on the file for writing.
- `OpenText()`: Creates a StreamReader on the file with UTF-8 encoding that reads the file as text.

## FileSystemInfo

- `FileSystemInfo` is the base class for `FileInfo` and `DirectoryInfo`.
- It provides common properties and methods for both files and directories, for example:
  - `Path`: Gets the full path of the file or directory.
  - `Name`: Gets the name of the file or directory.
  - `CreationDate`: Gets the date and time when the file or directory was created.
  - `LastModified`: Gets the date and time when the file or directory was last modified.
  - `Extension`: Gets the file extension of the file or directory.
