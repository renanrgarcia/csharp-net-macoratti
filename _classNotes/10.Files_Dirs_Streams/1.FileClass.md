# Files and Directories

- We have various classes in C# that allow us to work with files and directories.
- The most commonly used classes are:
  - `File`: Provides static methods for creating, copying, deleting, moving, and opening files.
  - `FileInfo`: Represents a file and provides instance methods for creating, copying, deleting, moving, and opening files.
  - `Directory`: Provides static methods for creating, moving, and enumerating through directories.
  - `DirectoryInfo`: Represents a directory and provides instance methods for creating, moving, and enumerating through directories.
  - `Path`: Provides methods for manipulating file and directory paths.
  - `FileStream`: Provides a stream for file operations, allowing reading and writing to files.
  - `StreamReader` and `StreamWriter`: Provide methods for reading from and writing to files using streams.
  - `BinaryReader` and `BinaryWriter`: Provide methods for reading and writing binary data to files.

## File Class

- The `File` class provides static methods for working with files. Belongs to the `System.IO` namespace.
- It allows you to create, copy, delete, move, and open files.
- Creating and manipulating methods:
  - `Create`: Creates a new file.
  - `Copy`: Copies an existing file to a new file. Don't overwrite the destination file if it already exists.
  - `Delete`: Deletes a specified file.
  - `Move`: Moves a specified file to a new location. Allows you to rename the file in the process.
  - `Open`: Opens an existing file.
- Reading and writing methods:
  - `ReadAllText`: Opens and reads all text from a file. Returns the content as a string and closes the file.
  - `ReadAllBytes`: Opens and reads all bytes from a file. Returns the content as a byte array and closes the file.
  - `WriteAllText`: Writes text to a file, overwriting any existing content.
  - `WriteAllBytes`: Writes bytes to a file, overwriting any existing content.
  - `AppendAllText`: Appends text to a file, creating the file if it doesn't exist.
- Another useful methods:
  - `ReadAllLines`: Reads all lines from a file and returns them as an array of strings.
  - `GetLastWriteTime`: Gets the date and time when the specified file was last written to.
  - `GetLastAccessTime`: Gets the date and time when the specified file was last accessed.
  - `OpenText`: Opens a file for reading text and returns a `StreamReader` object.
  - `Exists`: Checks if a specified file exists.

### Path and name

- There are two ways:
  - `string path = @"C:\path\to\file.txt";`
    - `@` is a verbatim string literal, allowing you to use backslashes without escaping them.
  - `string path = "C:\\path\\to\\file.txt";`
    - `\\` is used to escape the backslash character in a regular string literal.

### IOExceptions

- `IOException` is the base class for exceptions that occur during input/output operations.
- Main variations:
  - `FileNotFoundException`: Thrown when an attempt to access a file that does not exist.
  - `DirectoryNotFoundException`: Thrown when an attempt to access a directory that does not exist.
  - `UnauthorizedAccessException`: Thrown when the caller does not have the required permission to access a file or directory.
  - `PathTooLongException`: Thrown when a path or file name exceeds the system-defined maximum length.
  - `EndOfStreamException`: Thrown when an attempt is made to read past the end of a stream.
