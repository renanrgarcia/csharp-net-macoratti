# FileStream

- `FileStream` is a subclass of `Stream` that provides methods for reading and writing to files.
  - `Stream` is an abstract class that represents a sequence of bytes.
  - There are various types of streams, such as `MemoryStream`, `FileStream`, `NetworkStream`, `BufferedStream`, `PipeStream`, `CryptoStream`, etc.
- A `stream` is a sequence of bytes that can be read from or written to.
  - Can be used with pipes, files, network connections, etc.
- FileStream is used to read from and write to files in a more efficient way than using the File class directly.

## Helper Classes

- The `FileStream` class has some helper classes that comes from `Stream`:
  - `StreamReader`: Used to read characters from a byte stream in a specific encoding.
  - `StreamWriter`: Used to write characters to a byte stream in a specific encoding.
- So, first you need to create a `FileStream` object, then you can use `StreamReader` or `StreamWriter` to read or write characters.

## Create FileStream

- To create a `FileStream`, you can use the following constructor:

```csharp
FileStream fileStream = new FileStream("path/to/file.txt", FileMode.OpenOrCreate, FileAccess.ReadWrite, FileShare.Read);

// or
FileStream fileStream2 = File.Open("path/to/file.txt", FileMode.OpenOrCreate, FileAccess.ReadWrite, FileShare.Read);

// or
FileStream fileStream3 = new FileInfo("path/to/file.txt").Open(FileMode.OpenOrCreate, FileAccess.ReadWrite, FileShare.Read);
```

- The parameters are:
  - `path`: The path to the file.
  - `FileMode`: Specifies how the operating system should open the file. Common options include:
    - `OpenOrCreate`: Opens the file if it exists; otherwise, creates a new file.
    - `Create`: Specifies that the operating system should create a new file.
    - `CreateNew`: Specifies that the operating system should create a new file, and if the file already exists, an exception is thrown.
    - `Open`: Opens the file if it exists; otherwise, throws an exception.
    - `OpenOrCreate`: Opens the file if it exists; otherwise, creates a new file.
    - `Append`: Opens the file if it exists and seeks to the end of the file, or creates a new file.
    - `Truncate`: Opens the file if it exists and truncates its size to zero bytes.
  - `FileAccess`: Specifies the type of access to the file. Common options include:
    - `Read`: Read access to the file.
    - `Write`: Write access to the file.
    - `ReadWrite`: Read and write access to the file.
  - `FileShare`: Specifies the level of access other `FileStream` objects have to the same file. Common options include:
    - `Delete`: Other `FileStream` objects can delete the file.
    - `None`: No other `FileStream` can access the file.
    - `Read`: Other `FileStream` objects can read from the file.
    - `Write`: Other `FileStream` objects can write to the file.
    - `ReadWrite`: Other `FileStream` objects can read from and write to the file.

## Important: Dispose FileStream

- Always dispose the `FileStream` object when done to free up system resources.
- You can use a `using` statement to automatically dispose the `FileStream`:

```csharp
using (FileStream fileStream = new FileStream("path/to/file.txt", FileMode.OpenOrCreate, FileAccess.ReadWrite, FileShare.Read))
{
    // Use the fileStream
}

// After C# 8.0, you can also use the `using` declaration:
using FileStream fileStream = new FileStream("path/to/file.txt", FileMode.OpenOrCreate, FileAccess.ReadWrite, FileShare.Read);
```

- Alternatively, you can call the `Close` method explicitly:

```csharp
fileStream.Close();
```

## Properties

- `CanRead`: Gets a value indicating whether the current stream supports reading.
- `CanSeek`: Gets a value indicating whether the current stream supports seeking.
- `CanWrite`: Gets a value indicating whether the current stream supports writing.
- `Length`: Gets the length of the stream in bytes.
- `Position`: Gets or sets the current position within the stream.
- `Name`: Gets the name of the file associated with the `FileStream`.
- `IsAsync`: Gets a value indicating whether the `FileStream` is asynchronous.

## Methods

- `Read(byte[] buffer, int offset, int count)`: Reads a sequence of bytes from the current stream and advances the position within the stream by the number of bytes read.
- `Write(byte[] buffer, int offset, int count)`: Writes a sequence of bytes to the current stream and advances the current position within this stream by the number of bytes written.
- `Seek(long offset, SeekOrigin origin)`: Sets the position within the current stream.
- `Flush()`: Clears all buffers for the current stream and causes any buffered data to be written to the underlying device.
- `SetLength(long value)`: Sets the length of the current stream.
- `ReadAsync(byte[] buffer, int offset, int count, CancellationToken cancellationToken)`: Asynchronously reads a sequence of bytes from the current stream and advances the position within the stream by the number of bytes read.
- `WriteAsync(byte[] buffer, int offset, int count, CancellationToken cancellationToken)`: Asynchronously writes a sequence of bytes to the current stream and advances the current position within this stream by the number of bytes written.
- `CopyTo(Stream destination, int bufferSize)`: Copies the contents of the current stream to another stream.
