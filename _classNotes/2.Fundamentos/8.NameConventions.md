# Name Conventions

- **Identifiers**: Names used to identify variables, functions, classes, structs, records, delegates, enums, etc.
  - They must be significant and meaningful. And they have to be unique within their scope.
  - On C#, identifiers are case-sensitive.
  - They can contain letters, digits, and underscores. But they cannot start with a digit.
  - They cannot be a reserved keyword (e.g., `int`, `class`, `public`, etc.).
- **Naming conventions**: Guidelines for naming identifiers in a consistent and meaningful way.
  - **PascalCase**: Used for class names, method names, and public properties. The first letter of each word is capitalized.
    - Ex: `MyClass`, `CalculateTotal`, `GetUserName`
  - **camelCase**: Used for local variables and method parameters. The first letter of the first word is lowercase, and the first letter of subsequent words is capitalized.
    - Ex: `myVariable`, `totalAmount`, `userName`
  - **UPPER_CASE**: Used for constants. All letters are uppercase, and words are separated by underscores.
    - Ex: `MAX_VALUE`, `PI`, `DEFAULT_TIMEOUT`
  - **\_prefix**: Used for private fields and readonly. A single underscore is prefixed to the field name. Using camelCase for the field name.
    - Ex: `_privateField`, `_count`, `_isActive`
