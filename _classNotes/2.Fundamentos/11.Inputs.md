# Inputs

- `ReadLine()`: Reads a line of input from the console. It returns the input as a string, including the newline character.
- `Read()`: Reads the next character from the standard input stream. It returns the character as an integer (the ASCII value of the character) or -1 if no more characters are available. This method does not include the newline character in the returned value.
- `ReadKey()`: Reads a single key press from the console. It returns a `ConsoleKeyInfo` object that contains information about the key pressed, including the character and any modifier keys (like Shift or Ctrl) that were pressed at the same time.
  - Used to pause the program until a key is pressed.
