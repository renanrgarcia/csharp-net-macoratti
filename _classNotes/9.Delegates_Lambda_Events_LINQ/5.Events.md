# Events

- They notify classes or objects when something of interest occurs.
- Events are declared using the `event` keyword, which is a special type of delegate.
- There are two main components:
  - **Event Publisher**: The class that raises the event.
  - **Event Subscriber**: The class that listens for the event and responds to it.
- There can be multiple subscribers to a single event.
- The subscriber must register with the publisher to receive notifications and treat the event as a delegate.
- The methods that handle the event are called **event handlers**.
- Normally, events are button clicks or menu selections on GUI.

## Creating an Event

1. Declare a delegate that defines the signature of the event handler.
2. Declare an event of that delegate type in the publisher class.
3. Raise the event in the publisher class when the relevant action occurs.
4. In the subscriber class, create a method that matches the delegate signature.
5. Subscribe to the event by adding the method to the event in the publisher class.

## Example

```csharp
// Without Events. High Coupling
class Order
{
    public void CreateOrder()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Order Created");
        Email.Send();
        SMS.Send();
    }
}

class Email
{
    public static void Send()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Email Sent");
    }
}

class SMS
{
    public static void Send()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("SMS Sent");
    }
}
```

```csharp
// With Events. Low Coupling
class Order
{
    public delegate void OrderCreatedEventHandler();
    public event OrderCreatedEventHandler OrderCreated;

    public void CreateOrder()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Order Created");
        OnOrderCreated();
    }

    protected virtual void OnOrderCreated()
    {
        OrderCreated?.Invoke(this, EventArgs.Empty);
    }
}

class Email
{
    public static void Send()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Email Sent");
    }
}

class SMS
{
    public static void Send()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("SMS Sent");
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Order order = new Order();

        // Subscribe to the event
        order.OrderCreated += Email.Send;
        order.OrderCreated += SMS.Send;

        // Create an order
        order.CreateOrder();

        // Unsubscribe from the event
        order.OrderCreated -= Email.Send;
        order.OrderCreated -= SMS.Send;
    }
}
```
