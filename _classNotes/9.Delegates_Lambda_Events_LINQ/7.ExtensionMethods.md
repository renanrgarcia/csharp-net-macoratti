# Extension Methods

- They allow you to add new methods to existing types without modifying their source code.
- They are defined as static methods in a static class, with the first parameter specifying the type they extend.
- They can be called as if they were instance methods on the extended type.

## Creating as Extension Method

1. Define a static class, that must be visible to the code that will use the extension method.
2. Define a static method within that class, with at least the same accessibility as the class itself (usually `public`).
3. The first parameter of the method must be preceded by the `this` keyword, indicating the type it extends.
4. To call it, add the directive `using` to the namespace of the static class containing the extension method.
5. Call the method as if it were an instance method on the type being extended.

## Example

```csharp
using StringExtensionsNamespace;

string input = "Hello, World!";
string reversed = input.StringInversion();
Console.WriteLine(reversed); // Output: !dlroW ,olleH


// Extension method to reverse a string
namespace StringExtensionsNamespace;

public static class StringExtensions
{
    public static string StringInversion(this string str)
    {
        if (str == null) throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(str));
        char[] charArray = str.ToCharArray();
        Array.Reverse(charArray);
        return new string(charArray);
    }
}
```
