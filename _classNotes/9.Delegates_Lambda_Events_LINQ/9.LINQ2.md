# LINQ II

- **Query syntax or Expression syntax**: A syntax that resembles SQL, with keywords like `from`, `where`, `select`, and `orderby`.

  - Example:

    ```csharp
    var result = from object in dataSource // Initializes based on IEnumerable or IQueryable
                      where condition      // Condition with operators
                      select object;       // Selects the result, that can be grouped or filtered

    List<string> names = new List<string> { "Alice", "Bob", "Charlie" };
    var result = from name in names            // result is IEnumerable<string>
                      where name.Contains("a")
                      select name;

    foreach (var name in result)
        Console.WriteLine(name); // Output: Alice, Charlie
    ```

  - Comparing to SQL:
    ```sql
    SELECT object FROM dataSource WHERE condition
    ```

- **Method syntax**: A syntax that uses extension methods defined on `IEnumerable` and `IQueryable` interfaces.

  - Example:

    ```csharp
    var result = dataSource.Where(condition).Select(object);

    List<string> names = new List<string> { "Alice", "Bob", "Charlie" };
    var result = names.Where(name => name.Contains("a")); // result is IEnumerable<string>
    foreach (var name in result)
        Console.WriteLine(name); // Output: Alice, Charlie
    ```

- **Deferred execution**: LINQ queries are not executed until the results are actually needed, allowing for more efficient querying and manipulation of data.

## Differences between List<T> and IEnumerable<T>

- **List<T>**:
  - It is stored in memory and is a concrete implementation of a collection.
  - Represents a collection of objects that can be accessed by index.
  - Provides methods for adding, removing, and manipulating elements.
  - Implements `ICollection<T>` and `IList<T>`, allowing for more complex operations.
  - Supports random access to elements using an index.
- **IEnumerable<T>**:
  - Represents a collection of objects that can be enumerated.
  - Provides a simple way to iterate over a collection using `foreach`.
  - Does not support random access; elements can only be accessed sequentially.
  - It is the base interface for all non-generic collections in C#.
- `ToList()` is used to convert an `IEnumerable<T>` to a `List<T>`, allowing for more complex operations and random access to elements.
- `ToArray()` is used to convert an `IEnumerable<T>` to an array, which is a fixed-size collection that can be accessed by index.
