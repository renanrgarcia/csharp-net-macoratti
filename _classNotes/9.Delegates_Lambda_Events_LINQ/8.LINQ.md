# LINQ

- `LINQ` (Language Integrated Query) is a powerful feature in C# that allows querying collections in a more readable and concise way.
- `System.Linq` namespace provides a set of methods that can be used to query collections like arrays, lists, and other enumerable types.

## C# resources that supports LINQ

- **Query expressions**: A syntax that resembles SQL to query `IEnumerable and IQueryable` collections.
  - **IEnumerable**: Represents a collection of objects that can be enumerated, typically used for in-memory collections. Has the method `GetEnumerator()` to iterate over the collection.
  - **IQueryable**: Represents a collection that can be queried against a data source, such as a database, allowing for more complex queries and optimizations. It extends `IEnumerable`.
- **Extension methods**: Methods defined in the `System.Linq` namespace that can be called on any type that implements `IEnumerable<T>`.
- **Lambda expressions**: Anonymous functions that can be used to create delegates or expression tree types, often used in LINQ queries.
- **Anonymous types**: Types that are defined on-the-fly to hold data without explicitly defining a class.
- **Implicitly typed variables**: Variables declared with the `var` keyword, allowing the compiler to infer their type based on the assigned value.
- **Object and collection initializers**: Syntax that allows initializing objects and collections in a more concise way. They are used on query expressions to create new objects or collections directly from the results of a query.

## Main resources

- **Integrated queries**: Queries that are written directly in C# code using LINQ syntax.
- **Intellisense**: Provides code completion and suggestions for LINQ queries in Visual Studio.
- **Strong typing**: LINQ queries are strongly typed, meaning that the compiler checks the types of the elements being queried at compile time.
- **Various data types supported**: LINQ can be used with various data types, including arrays, lists, dictionaries, and custom collections that implement `IEnumerable<T>`.
- **Standard query operators**: A set of predefined methods in the `System.Linq` namespace that can be used to perform common operations on collections, such as filtering, sorting, and grouping. Like: `Where`, `Select`, `OrderBy`, `GroupBy`, etc.
- **Deferred execution**: LINQ queries are not executed until the results are actually needed, allowing for more efficient querying and manipulation of data.
- **Immediate execution**: Some LINQ methods, like `ToList()`, `ToArray()`, and `Count()`, force immediate execution of the query and return the results immediately.
- **Support for various data sources**: LINQ can be used with various data sources, including in-memory collections, databases (using LINQ to SQL or Entity Framework), XML documents (using LINQ to XML), and more.

## Using LINQ

1. Define data source.
2. Create a query using LINQ syntax or method syntax.
3. Execute the query and process the results.
