# MultiCast Delegate

- Different from a single cast delegate, a multicast delegate can hold references to multiple methods.
- When invoked, it calls all the methods in the invocation list in the order they were added.
- The return value of a multicast delegate is the return value of the last method in the invocation list.
- It is util when you want to perform multiple actions in response to a single event or action.

## Creating a Multicast Delegate

- Define a delegate type with the desired signatures of the methods it will encapsulate.
- Use the `+=` operator to add methods to the delegate's invocation list.
- Use the `-=` operator to remove methods from the invocation list.

```csharp
static void Method1(string message)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Method 1: {message}");
}

static void Method2(string message)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Method 2: {message}");
}

public delegate void MyMulticastDelegate(string message);
```
