# Parallel vs Asynchronous Programming

- **Asynchronous Programming**: allows multiple tasks to run simultaneously, without thread blocking.
  - This is achieved by using `async` and `await` keywords in C#.
  - Also the Task Parallel Library (TPL) can be used to run tasks in parallel.
  - It is useful for I/O-bound operations where waiting for a response is common.
  - It helps in improving the responsiveness of applications, especially in UI applications.
- **Parallel Programming**: focuses on executing multiple tasks at the same time, utilizing multiple CPU cores.

  - It is typically used for CPU-bound operations where tasks can be executed concurrently.
  - The `Parallel` class in C# provides methods to run loops and tasks in parallel.
  - It is beneficial for performance optimization in computationally intensive applications.

- **Key Differences**:
  - Asynchronous programming is about non-blocking operations, while parallel programming is about concurrent execution of tasks.
  - Asynchronous programming is more about managing I/O operations, while parallel programming is about utilizing CPU resources effectively.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Use asynchronous programming for tasks like web requests, file I/O, and database queries.
  - Use parallel programming for tasks like data processing, image rendering, and mathematical computations.

# Asynchronous vs Synchronous programming

- **Synchronous Programming**: tasks are executed one after another, blocking the thread until the current task is completed.
  - This can lead to performance issues, especially in applications that require responsiveness.
- **Asynchronous Programming**: allows tasks to be executed without blocking the thread, enabling other tasks to run while waiting for a response.
  - This improves application responsiveness and performance, especially in I/O-bound scenarios.
