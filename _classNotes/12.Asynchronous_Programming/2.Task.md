# Task and Task<T>

- A `Task` represents an asynchronous operation.
- A `Task<T>` represents an asynchronous operation that returns a value of type `T`.
- They are part of the System.Threading.Tasks namespace.
- They support `async` and `await` keywords for easier asynchronous programming.
  - `async` modifies a method to indicate it contains asynchronous operations.
  - `await` is used to pause the execution of an async method until the awaited task completes.

## Returning Values

- **Task**: Use when you do not need to return a value.
- **Task<T>**: Use when you need to return a value of type `T`.
