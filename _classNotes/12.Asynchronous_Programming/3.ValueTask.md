# ValueTask and ValueTask<T>

- Why use `ValueTask`?
  - `ValueTask` is a lightweight alternative to `Task` for scenarios where the result is often available synchronously.
  - `Task` and `Task<T>` are reference types and allocate memory on the heap, which can lead to performance overhead. Also uses Garbage Collection (GC), which can be expensive.
- `ValueTask` are value types (structs) and do not incur the same allocation overhead as `Task`.

## When to use `ValueTask`

- Use `ValueTask` when:
  - The result of the operation is often available synchronously.
  - You want to avoid the overhead of allocating a `Task` object.
  - When there is asynchronous scenario with a buffered result.
  - When the result is concluded synchronously.
