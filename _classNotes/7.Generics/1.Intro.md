# Generics

- Generics are a powerful feature in programming languages that allow you to write code that can work with any data type. They enable you to create classes, interfaces, and methods that can operate on different types without the need for code duplication.
- Syntax:
  - `class ClassName<T>`: This defines a generic class with a type parameter `T`.
  - `interface InterfaceName<T>`: This defines a generic interface with a type parameter `T`.
  - `methodName<T>(T parameter)`: This defines a generic method with a type parameter `T`.
- Generics are often used in data structures, algorithms, and APIs to provide type safety and flexibility. They allow you to create reusable components that can work with different types without sacrificing performance or readability.
- Example:

```csharp
class GenericClass<T1, T2>
{
    private T1 data1;
    private T2 data2;

    public GenericClass(T1 data1, T2 data2)
    {
        this.data1 = data1;
        this.data2 = data2;
    }

    public T1 GetData1()
    {
        return data1;
    }

    public T2 GetData2()
    {
        return data2;
    }
}
```

## Constraints

- We can use `where` keyword to specify constraints on the type parameters. This allows us to restrict the types that can be used as arguments for the generic type parameters.
- Syntax:
  - `where T : struct`: This constraint specifies that the type parameter `T` must be a value type (struct).
  - `where T : class, new()`: This constraint specifies that the type parameter `T` must be a reference type (class) and must have a parameterless constructor.
  - `public void MethodName<T>(T arg) where T : class`: This method can only accept reference types as arguments.
  - `where T : <base_class_name>`: This constraint specifies that the type parameter `T` must inherit from a specific base class.
  - `where T : <interface_name>`: This constraint specifies that the type parameter `T` must implement a specific interface.
  - `public class GenericClass<T1, T2> where T1 : class, new() where T2 : struct`: This generic class can only accept reference types for `T1` and value types for `T2`.

## Benefits

- `Code Reusability`: Generics allow you to write code that can work with any data type, reducing code duplication and improving maintainability.
- `Type Safety`: Generics provide compile-time type checking, reducing the risk of runtime errors and improving code reliability.
- `Performance`: Generics can improve performance by eliminating the need for boxing and unboxing operations, which can be costly in terms of memory and processing time.

## System.Collections.Generic

- The `System.Collections.Generic` namespace provides a set of generic collections that are optimized for performance and type safety. These collections include:
  - `Collection<T>`: A base class for all generic collections that provides basic functionality for adding, removing, and enumerating elements.
  - `List<T>`: A dynamic array that can grow and shrink in size.
  - `Dictionary<TKey, TValue>`: A collection of key-value pairs that allows fast lookups by key.
  - `HashSet<T>`: A collection of unique elements that provides fast lookups and insertions.
  - `Queue<T>`: A first-in, first-out (FIFO) collection that allows adding and removing elements from both ends.
  - `Stack<T>`: A last-in, first-out (LIFO) collection that allows adding and removing elements from the top.

## Generics on class and method level

- Generics can be applied at both the class level and the method level. This allows you to create generic classes that can contain generic methods, or generic methods that can be used within non-generic classes. The syntax for defining generics at both levels is similar, but the scope and usage may differ.
- When using each level of generics:
  - Class-level: when you want to create a class that can work with multiple types of data.
  - Method-level: when you want to create a method that can work with multiple types of data, but the class itself does not need to be generic.
  - Both levels: when you want to create a class that can work with multiple types of data and also have methods that can work with different types of data.
- Example:

```csharp
// Generic class with a generic method
class GenericClass<T>
{
    public void GenericMethod<T>(T parameter)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Generic method called with parameter: {parameter}");
    }
}

// Non-generic class with a generic method
class NonGenericClass
{
    public void GenericMethod<T>(T parameter)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Generic method called with parameter: {parameter}");
    }
}

// Generic class with a non-generic method
class GenericClass<T>
{
    public void NonGenericMethod()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Non-generic method called");
    }
}
```
