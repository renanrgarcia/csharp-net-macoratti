# GetHashCode and Equals in Generics

- These methods are crucial for comparing objects and determining their equality in collections.
- They are inherited from the `System.Object` class, which is the base class for all types in C#.
- `Equals`: Determines whether two objects are equal, returning `true` if they are the same and `false` otherwise.
  - For primitive types, the default implementation compares values.
  - For reference types, it checks if the references point to the same object in memory.
- `GetHashCode`: Returns a hash code for the object, which is used in hash-based collections like `Dictionary` and `HashSet`.
  - Is faster than `Equals` and is used to quickly locate objects in collections.
  - For primitive types, it returns a hash code based on the value.
  - For reference types, it returns a hash code based on the object's memory address.
- We need to override these methods when creating custom types to ensure correct behavior in collections and comparisons.
- So, the strategy is to use the `GetHashCode` method to quickly locate objects in collections that have the same hashcode, and after the `Equals` method to confirm if two objects are equal.

## Overriding Equals and GetHashCode

```csharp
public class Person
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Cpf { get; set; }

    public Person(string name, int cpf)
    {
        Name = name;
        Cpf = cpf;
    }

    public override bool Equals(object obj)
    {
        if (obj == null || GetType() != obj.GetType() || obj is not Person)
        {
            return false;
        }

        if (obj is Person other)
        {
            // return Name == other.Name && Cpf == other.Cpf;
            return Cpf == other.Cpf; // Assuming Cpf is unique for each person
        }

        return false;
    }

    public override int GetHashCode()
    {
        // return HashCode.Combine(Name, Cpf);
        return Cpf.GetHashCode(); // Assuming Cpf is unique for each person
    }
}

public class Program
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        Person person1 = new Person("Alice", 123456789);
        Person person2 = new Person("Alice", 123456789);
        Person person3 = new Person("Bob", 987654321);

        Console.WriteLine(person1.Equals(person2)); // True
        Console.WriteLine(person1.Equals(person3)); // False

        HashSet<Person> people = new HashSet<Person>();
        people.Add(person1);
        people.Add(person2); // Will not be added, as it's considered equal to person1
        people.Add(person3);

        Console.WriteLine(people.Count); // 2
    }
}
```
