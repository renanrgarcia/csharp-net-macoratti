# Stack

- A stack is a data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle.
- Can have duplicate elements and null values.
- It is util when we need temporary storage of data to obtain information, in other words, when we want to discard the data after using it.
- It is implemented using the `Stack<T>` class in C#.
- Provides type verification at compile time, ensuring that only elements of the specified type can be added to the stack. Don't execute boxing and unboxing operations.
- It's not possible to use the collection initializer syntax with `Stack<T>`.
- Does not support indexing or enumeration in a sorted order, as it is not an ordered collection.
- The capacity of a stack is the number of elements it can hold before it needs to resize. The default capacity is 0, and it grows as needed when elements are added.

## Constructors

- `Stack<T>()`: Initializes a new, empty stack.
- `Stack<T>(IEnumerable<T> collection)`: Initializes a new stack that contains elements copied from the specified collection.
- `Stack<T>(int capacity)`: Initializes a new stack with a specified initial capacity.

## Methods

- `Push(T item)`: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
- `Pop()`: Removes and returns the element at the top of the stack. Throws an `InvalidOperationException` if the stack is empty.
- `Peek()`: Returns the element at the top of the stack without removing it. Throws an `InvalidOperationException` if the stack is empty.
