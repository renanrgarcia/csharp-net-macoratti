# Collections

## Non-generic Collections

- Non-generic collections are collections that can hold any type of object, but they do not provide type safety. They are part of the `System.Collections` namespace and include:
  - `ArrayList`: A dynamically sized array that can hold any type of object.
  - `Hashtable`: A collection of key-value pairs where keys are unique.
  - `Queue`: A first-in, first-out (FIFO) collection.
  - `Stack`: A last-in, first-out (LIFO) collection.
  - `SortedList`: A collection of key-value pairs sorted by keys.
- Caracteristics:
  - They store elements as `object`, which means you need to cast them to the appropriate type when retrieving elements.
  - They do not provide compile-time type checking, which can lead to runtime errors if you try to retrieve an element of the wrong type.
  - They are less efficient than generic collections because of boxing and unboxing operations.

## Generic Collections

- Generic collections are collections that are type-safe and can hold elements of a specific type. They are part of the `System.Collections.Generic` namespace and include:
  - `Dictionary<TKey, TValue>`: A collection of key-value pairs where keys are of type `TKey` and values are of type `TValue`.
  - `SortedDictionary<TKey, TValue>`: A collection of key-value pairs sorted by keys, where keys are of type `TKey` and values are of type `TValue`.
  - `List<T>`: A dynamically sized array that can hold elements of type `T`.
  - `LinkedList<T>`: A doubly linked list that can hold elements of type `T`.
  - `SortedList<TKey, TValue>`: A collection of key-value pairs sorted by keys, where keys are of type `TKey` and values are of type `TValue`.
  - `HashSet<T>`: A collection of unique elements of type `T`.
  - `SortedSet<T>`: A collection of unique elements of type `T` sorted in ascending order.
  - `Queue<T>`: A first-in, first-out (FIFO) collection of elements of type `T`.
  - `Stack<T>`: A last-in, first-out (LIFO) collection of elements of type `T`.
- Caracteristics:
  - They provide compile-time type checking, which reduces the risk of runtime errors.
  - They are more efficient than non-generic collections because they do not require boxing and unboxing operations.
  - They allow you to work with specific types, improving code readability and maintainability.
  - They facilitate the reuse of code.

## Generic x Non-generic Collections

- Non-generic collections are considered obsolete in modern C# programming for developers and even Microsoft recommends using generic collections instead.
- Generic collections provide better performance, type safety, and code readability.
