# JSON Serialization

- JSON serialization converts an object into a JSON format, which is a lightweight, text-based format that is easy to read and write.
- It is widely used in web applications for data interchange due to its simplicity and compatibility with JavaScript.
- JSON serialization is supported in .NET through libraries like `System.Text.Json` and `Newtonsoft.Json`.
