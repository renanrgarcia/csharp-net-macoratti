# Serialization

- Serialization is the process of converting an object into a format that can be easily stored or transmitted and then reconstructed later.
- In .NET, serialization is commonly used for saving the state of an object to a file, sending it over a network, or storing it in a database.

## Types of Serialization

1. **Binary Serialization**: Converts an object into a binary format. This is efficient in terms of space and speed but is not human-readable.
2. **XML Serialization**: Converts an object into an XML format. This is human-readable and can be easily edited but is generally larger in size compared to binary serialization.
3. **JSON Serialization**: Converts an object into a JSON format. This is also human-readable and is widely used in web applications for data interchange.
4. **Custom Serialization**: Allows developers to define how an object should be serialized and deserialized, providing full control over the process.

## Common Use Cases

- Persisting application state
- Remoting and web services
- Caching data
- Communication between different parts of a distributed system

## .NET Serialization Types

- **Binary Serialization** (System.Runtime.Serialization): Uses the `BinaryFormatter` class to serialize objects into a binary format.
  - Actually, `BinaryFormatter` is considered obsolete in .NET 5 and later due to security concerns. Alternatives like `System.Text.Json` or `Newtonsoft.Json` for JSON serialization are recommended.
  - Preserves the type fidelity and object state.
- **XML/SOAP Serialization** (System.Xml.Serialization): Uses the `XmlSerializer` class to serialize objects into XML format.
  - Only public properties and fields are serialized. Does not preserve type fidelity.
- **JSON Serialization** (System.Text.Json or Newtonsoft.Json): Converts objects to JSON format.
  - Actually, `System.Text.Json` is the preferred library in .NET Core and .NET 5+ for JSON serialization and has native support in .NET Core.
  - `Newtonsoft.Json` (Json.NET) is still widely used and provides more features, but `System.Text.Json` is faster and more efficient.
  - Only public properties are serialized by default, but can be customized. Does not preserve type fidelity.

# Deserialization

- Deserialization is the reverse process of serialization, where the serialized data is converted back into an object.
- Recovering the original object from serialized data can sometimes lead to issues if the class structure has changed since serialization.
