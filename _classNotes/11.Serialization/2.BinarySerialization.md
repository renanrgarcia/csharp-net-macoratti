# Binary Serialization (Obsolete)

- In binary serialization, private and public fields of the object and the class name, including its assembly, are converted into a byte stream, then saved to a data stream or file.
  - This way, an exact copy of the object can be created later by deserializing the byte stream.
- Error: Binary serialization is not recommended for new development due to security and compatibility issues.
- Binary serialization is not supported in .NET Core and later versions.
