# Reference Types

- `object`: The base type from which all other types derive. It can hold any data type, including value types and reference types. .NET type: `System.Object`.
- `string`: A sequence of characters used to represent text. Strings are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed after creation. .NET type: `System.String`.
  - Better use `StringBuilder` for mutable strings.
- `dynamic`: A type that bypasses compile-time type checking. It allows you to work with objects whose types are not known until runtime. .NET type: `System.Object`.
  - It's useful when working with `reflection` (used to return types metadata on runtime) or with dynamic languages (e.g., Python, JavaScript).
- Their default value is `null`.
