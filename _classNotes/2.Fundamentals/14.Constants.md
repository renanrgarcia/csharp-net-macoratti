# Constants

- They are used to define values that do not change during the execution of a program.
- They are declared using the `const` keyword followed by the type, name, and value.
- Exs:

```csharp
  const int MAX_VALUE = 100;
  const double PI = 3.14159;
  const string GREETING = "Hello, World!";

  const int MONTHS_IN_YEAR = 12, DAYS_IN_YEAR = 365;

  const float DAYS_IN_WEEK = (float) DAYS_IN_YEAR / MONTHS_IN_YEAR;
```
