# Logical Operators

- `&&` (Logical AND): Returns true if both operands are true.
- `||` (Logical OR): Returns true if at least one operand is true.
- `!` (Logical NOT): Returns true if the operand is false, and false if the operand is true.

## Operators associativity and precedence

- Operators are evaluated based on their precedence and associativity.
- () and [] have the highest precedence.
- Decreasing order of precedence and associativity:
  1. `Arithmetic Operators`: \* / % + - (left to right)
  2. `Attribution Operators`: = += -= \*= /= %= &= |= ^= <<= >>= (right to left)
  3. `Increment and Decrement Operators`: ++ -- (right to left)
  4. `Relational Operators`: < > <= >= == != (left to right)
  5. `Logical Operators`: && || (left to right), ! (right to left)

## Ternary Operator

- The ternary operator is a shorthand for an if-else statement.
- Syntax: `condition ? trueExpression : falseExpression;`
  - Example: `int result = (a > b) ? a : b;` assigns the greater of a and b to result.
- We can nest ternary operators for multiple conditions.
  - Example: `int result = (a > b) ? a : (b > c) ? b : c;` assigns the largest of a, b, and c to result.
